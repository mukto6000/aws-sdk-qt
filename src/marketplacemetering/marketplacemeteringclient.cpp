 * 
 *  BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering
 *  records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use
 *  CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the <i> <a

 *
 * entitlement> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <i>Entitlement</i>: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the customer running your paid software is subscribed to
 * your product on AWS Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your container image that integrates
 * with RegisterUsage is only required to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a
 * CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will only be thrown on the initial call to RegisterUsage.
 * Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) will not throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException,
 * even if the customer unsubscribes while the Amazon ECS task is still
 *
 * running> </li> <li>
 *
 * <i>Metering</i>: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per hour, with usage prorated to the second. A minimum
 * of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a customer has a 10 node ECS cluster and
 * creates an ECS service configured as a Daemon Set, then ECS will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer
 * will be charged: (10 * hourly_rate). Metering for software use is automatically handled by the AWS Marketplace Metering
 * Control Plane -- your software is not required to perform any metering specific actions, other than call RegisterUsage
 * once for metering of software use to commence. The AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill
 * customers for running ECS tasks, regardless of the customers subscription state, removing the need for your software to
 * perform entitlement checks at
