 * \class QtAws::MarketplaceMetering::BatchMeterUsageRequest
 * \brief The BatchMeterUsageRequest class provides an interface for MarketplaceMetering BatchMeterUsage requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsMarketplaceMetering
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service
 * 
 *  API>
 * 
 *  AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage
 * 
 *  dimensions>
 * 
 *  <b>Submitting Metering Records</b>
 * 
 *  </p <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <i>MeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2
 * 
 *  instance> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <i>BatchMeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a set of customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a
 *  software-as-a-service (SaaS)
 * 
 *  application> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  <b>Accepting New Customers</b>
 * 
 *  </p <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <i>ResolveCustomer</i>- Called by a SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your website
 *  during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration Token is
 *  resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier and Product
 * 
 *  Code> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b>
 * 
 *  </p <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service
 *  and call the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Calling RegisterUsage from containers
 *  running outside of Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECR) isn't supported. Free and BYOL products for ECS aren't
 *  required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more
 *  information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html">Container-Based
 *  Products</a>.
 * 
 *  </p </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering
 *  records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use
 *  CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the <i> <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>
