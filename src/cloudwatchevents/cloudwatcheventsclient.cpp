 *
 *  Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your Amazon Web Services resources. When your resources
 *  change state, they automatically send events to an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the
 *  stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For
 *  example, you can configure rules
 * 
 *  to> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Automatically invoke an Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters
 *  the running
 * 
 *  state> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential security
 *  or availability

 * 
 *  Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS

 * Running <code>PutPermission</code> permits the specified Amazon Web Services account or Amazon Web Services organization

 *
 * </p
 *
 * For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have an EventBridge rule with your

 *
 * To enable multiple Amazon Web Services accounts to put events to your event bus, run <code>PutPermission</code> once for
 * each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts are members of the same Amazon Web Services organization, you can run
 * <code>PutPermission</code> once specifying <code>Principal</code> as "*" and specifying the Amazon Web Services
 * organization ID in <code>Condition</code>, to grant permissions to all accounts in that
 *
 * organization>
 *
 * If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a <code>RoleArn</code>
 * with proper permissions when they use <code>PutTarget</code> to add your account's event bus as a target. For more

 *
 * A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by Amazon Web Services services go to your
 * account's default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event
 * bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a
 * custom event bus that you have created. For more information, see <a
 *
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEventBus.html">CreateEventBus</a>>
 *
 * If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this <code>PutRule</code> command.
 * If you omit arguments in <code>PutRule</code>, the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are
 * replaced with null
 *
 * values>
 *
 * When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a
 * short period of time for changes to take
 *
 * effect>
 *
 * A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a
 * matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have
 * both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a
 *
 * schedule>
 *
 * When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and
 * categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or
 * change only rules with certain tag values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and assign tags, you must have both
 * the <code>events:PutRule</code> and <code>events:TagResource</code>
 *
 * permissions>
 *
 * If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the <code>PutRule</code> operation are ignored. To update
 * the tags of an existing rule, use <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html">TagResource</a> and <a

 *
 * Most services in Amazon Web Services treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However,
 * EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating
 * event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to
 *
 * match>
 *
 * In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For
 * example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired
 * state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an
 * infinite
 *
 * loop>
 *
 * To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule
 * could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you
 * when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information, see <a

 *
 * To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions.
 * For Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis Data

 * the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For more information, see <a

 *
 * If another Amazon Web Services account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using
 * <code>PutPermission</code>), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules
 * in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the
 * <code>Arn</code> value when you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your
 * account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account
