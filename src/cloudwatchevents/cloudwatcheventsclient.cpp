 * \inmodule QtAwsCloudWatchEvents
 *
 *  Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state, they
 *  automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route
 *  them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can
 *  configure rules
 * 
 *  to> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance
 *  enters the running
 * 
 *  stat> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential
 *  security or availability

 * 
 *  Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS

 * self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an <code>EventPattern</code> and a
 * <code>ScheduleExpression</code>, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a
 *
 * schedule>
 *
 * When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and
 * categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or
 * change only rules with certain tag values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and assign tags, you must have both
 * the <code>events:PutRule</code> and <code>events:TagResource</code>

 *
 * Most services in AWS treat <code>:</code> or <code>/</code> as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
 * However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when
 * creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event that you want to
 *
 * match>
 *
 * In EventBridge, you could create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a
 * rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If
 * you don't write the rule carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite
 *
 * loop>
 *
 * To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions don't refire the same rule. For example, your rule could
 * fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you

 * Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only on the AWS Management Console. The built-in targets are <code>EC2
 * CreateSnapshot API call</code>, <code>EC2 RebootInstances API call</code>, <code>EC2 StopInstances API call</code>, and
 * <code>EC2 TerminateInstances API call</code>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For some target types, <code>PutTargets</code> provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data
 * stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the <code>KinesisParameters</code> argument.
 * To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code>
 *
 * field>
 *
 * To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions.
 * For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data
 * streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the
 * <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html">Authentication
 * and Access Control</a> in the <i>Amazon EventBridge User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * If another AWS account is in the same Region and has granted you permission (using <code>PutPermission</code>), you can
 * send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched
 * events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when you run
 * <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event.
 * Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event isn't charged. For more
 * information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/">Amazon EventBridge
 *
 * Pricing</a>>
 *
 * If you're setting an event bus in another account as the target and that account granted permission to your account
 * through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, you must specify a <code>RoleArn</code> with proper
 * permissions in the <code>Target</code> structure. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html">Sending
 * and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts</a> in the <i>Amazon EventBridge User

 * parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched

 *
 * passed)> </li> <li>
 *
 * If <code>InputTransformer</code> is specified, one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as
 * values in a template that you specify as the input to the

 *
 * When you specify <code>InputPath</code> or <code>InputTransformer</code>, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket
