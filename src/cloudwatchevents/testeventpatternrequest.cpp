 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsCloudWatchEvents
 *
 *  Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state, they
 *  automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route
 *  them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can
 *  configure rules
 * 
 *  to> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance
 *  enters the running
 * 
 *  stat> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential
 *  security or availability
 * 
 *  risk> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS
 * 
 *  volum> </li> </ul>
