 * \class QtAws::GuardDuty::StartMonitoringMembersResponse
 * \brief The StartMonitoringMembersResponse class provides an interace for GuardDuty StartMonitoringMembers responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsGuardDuty
 *
 *  Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following data sources: VPC
 *  Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence feeds (such as lists of malicious IPs
 *  and domains) and machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your
 *  AWS environment. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication
 *  with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances that serve malware or
 *  mine bitcoin.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  GuardDuty also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise. Some examples of this are unauthorized
 *  infrastructure deployments such as EC2 instances deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls
 *  like a password policy change to reduce password strength.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  GuardDuty informs you of the status of your AWS environment by producing security findings that you can view in the
 *  GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more information, see the <i> <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html">Amazon GuardDuty User Guide</a> </i>.
