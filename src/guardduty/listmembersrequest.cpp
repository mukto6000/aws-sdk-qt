 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsGuardDuty
 *
 *  Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following data sources: VPC
 *  Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IPs
 *  and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity within your
 *  AWS environment. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication
 *  with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances serving malware or
 *  mining bitcoin. It also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as unauthorized
 *  infrastructure deployments, like instances deployed in a region that has never been used, or unusual API calls, like a
 *  password policy change to reduce password strength. GuardDuty informs you of the status of your AWS environment by
 *  producing security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more
 *  information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html"> Amazon GuardDuty User
 *  Guide</a>.
