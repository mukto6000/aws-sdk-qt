 * \class QtAws::GuardDuty::DisableOrganizationAdminAccountResponse
 * \brief The DisableOrganizationAdminAccountResponse class provides an interace for GuardDuty DisableOrganizationAdminAccount responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsGuardDuty
 *
 *  Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following data sources: VPC
 *  Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event logs, EKS audit logs, and DNS logs. It uses
 *  threat intelligence feeds (such as lists of malicious IPs and domains) and machine learning to identify unexpected,
 *  potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your Amazon Web Services environment. This can include issues
 *  like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For
 *  example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances that serve malware or mine bitcoin.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for signs of compromise. Some examples of this are
 *  unauthorized infrastructure deployments such as EC2 instances deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual
 *  API calls like a password policy change to reduce password strength.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  GuardDuty informs you of the status of your Amazon Web Services environment by producing security findings that you can
 *  view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more information, see the <i> <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html">Amazon GuardDuty User Guide</a> </i>.
