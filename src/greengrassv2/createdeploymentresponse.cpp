 *
 *  AWS IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge
 *  devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to
 *  local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely
 *  with AWS IoT Core and export IoT data to the AWS Cloud. AWS IoT Greengrass developers can use AWS Lambda functions and
 *  components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local
 * 
 *  operation>
 * 
 *  AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new
 *  console. Use this API reference to learn how to use the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components,
 *  manage deployments, and core
