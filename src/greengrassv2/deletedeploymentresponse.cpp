 *
 *  IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices.
 *  This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local
 *  events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with
 *  Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use
 *  Lambda functions and components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local
 * 
 *  operation>
 * 
 *  IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console.
 *  Use this API reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components, manage
 *  deployments, and core
 * 
 *  devices>
