 * \class QtAws::Signer::DescribeSigningJobRequest
 * \brief The DescribeSigningJobRequest class provides an interface for Signer DescribeSigningJob requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsSigner
 *
 *  AWS Signer is a fully managed code signing service to help you ensure the trust and integrity of your code.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  AWS Signer supports the following
 * 
 *  applications>
 * 
 *  With <i>code signing for AWS Lambda</i>, you can sign AWS Lambda deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for
 *  Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use
 *  Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  With <i>code signing for IoT</i>, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS. IoT code signing is
 *  available for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/">Amazon FreeRTOS</a> and <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/">AWS IoT Device Management</a>, and is integrated with <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign code, you
 *  import a third-party code signing certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT
 *  Device Management.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  For more information about AWS Signer, see the <a
