 *
 *  AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) Portal is a web service that makes it easy for you to assign
 *  user access to IAM Identity Center resources such as the AWS access portal. Users can get AWS account applications and
 *  roles assigned to them and get federated into the
 * 
 *  application> <note>
 * 
 *  Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will
 *  continue to retain their original name for backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM Identity Center
 * 
 *  rename</a>> </note>
 * 
 *  This reference guide describes the IAM Identity Center Portal operations that you can call programatically and includes
 *  detailed information on data types and
 * 
 *  errors> <note>
 * 
 *  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms, such as
 *  Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, or Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity
 *  Center and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see
