 *  <fullname>Amazon DynamoDB</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless
 *  scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so
 *  that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or
 *  cluster
 * 
 *  scaling>
 * 
 *  With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of
 *  request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance
 *  degradation, and use the AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance
 * 
 *  metrics>
 * 
 *  DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your
 *  throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on
 *  solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region, providing
 *  built-in high availability and data durability.
