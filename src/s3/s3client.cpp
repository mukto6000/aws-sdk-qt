 *
 * Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins
 * processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in

 *
 * <b>Metadata</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not
 * preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL
 * when generating a copy request. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the
 * request, you can optionally add the <code>x-amz-metadata-directive</code> header. When you grant permissions, you can
 * use the <code>s3:x-amz-metadata-directive</code> condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are
 * uploaded. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html">Specifying Conditions in a Policy</a>
 * in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html">Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for
 * Amazon
 *
 * S3</a>>
 *
 * <b> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if</code> Headers</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the <code>Etag</code> matches or whether the object was
 * modified before or after a specified date, use the following request
 *
 * parameters> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code>
 *
 * </p </li> </ul>
 *
 * If both the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> headers are
 * present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> and copies the
 *
 * data> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> condition evaluates to
 *
 * tru> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> condition evaluates to
 *
 * fals> </li> </ul>
 *
 * If both the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> headers
 * are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> response
 *
 * code> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> condition evaluates to
 *
 * fals> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> condition evaluates to
 *
 * tru> </li> </ul> <note>
 *
 * All headers with the <code>x-amz-</code> prefix, including <code>x-amz-copy-source</code>, must be
 *
 * signed> </note>
 *
 * <b>Server-side encryption</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt
 * the object using server-side encryption with AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided
 * encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers
 * and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Using Server-Side
 *
 * Encryption</a>>
 *
 * If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html">Amazon S3 Bucket Keys</a> in the <i>Amazon S3
 * User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * <b>Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are
 * private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS
 * accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For
 * more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List
 * (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html">Managing ACLs
 * Using the REST API</a>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * <b>Storage Class Options</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * You can use the <code>CopyObject</code> action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon
 * S3 using the <code>StorageClass</code> parameter. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html">Storage Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3
 * User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * <b>Versioning</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version
 * is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the
 * <code>versionId</code>
 *
 * subresource>
 *
 * If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This
 * version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object
 * in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the
 *
 * response>
 *
 * If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always
 *
 * null>
 *
 * If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a

 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload and

 *
 * For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or
 * more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There
 * is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests (AWS
 * Signature Version
 *
 * 4)</a>> <note>
 *
 * After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded
 * parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and
 * stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.
 *
 * </p </note>
 *
 * You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes
 * it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS
 * Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to
 * provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a> and <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match
 * the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have permission to the
 * <code>kms:Decrypt</code> and <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required
 * because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For
 * more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions">Multipart upload API and
 * permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User

 *
 * If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you
 * must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key,
 * then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or

 * Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use <code>GET</code>, you must have <code>READ</code> access to the object. If you
 * grant <code>READ</code> access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization
 *
 * header>
 *
 * An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can,
 * however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of
 * naming an object <code>sample.jpg</code>, you can name it
 *
 * <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>>
 *
 * To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the <code>GET</code>
 * operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object
 * <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>, specify the resource as <code>/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>. For
 * a path-style request example, if you have the object <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code> in the bucket named
 * <code>examplebucket</code>, specify the resource as <code>/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>. For

 *
 * If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3
 * Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must

 * S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest
 *
 * error>
 *
 * If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store
 * the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following

 *
 * <b>Permissions</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * You need the <code>s3:GetObject</code> permission for this operation. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html">Specifying Permissions in a
 * Policy</a>. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the
 * <code>s3:ListBucket</code>
 *
 * permission> <ul> <li>
 *
 * If you have the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no
 * such key")
 *
 * error> </li> <li>
 *
 * If you don’t have the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 ("access
 * denied")
 *
 * error> </li> </ul>
 *
 * <b>Versioning</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the
 * <code>versionId</code>
 *
 * subresource> <note>
 *
 * If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes
 * <code>x-amz-delete-marker: true</code> in the
 *
 * response> </note>
 *
 * For more information about versioning, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html">PutBucketVersioning</a>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * <b>Overriding Response Header Values</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might
 * override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET
 *
 * request>
 *
 * You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values
 * are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override
 * using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers
 * that you can override for the GET response are <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>,
 * <code>Expires</code>, <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Content-Disposition</code>, and <code>Content-Encoding</code>.
 * To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request
 *
 * parameters> <note>
 *
 * You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They
 * cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous)
 *
 * request> </note> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>response-content-type</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>response-content-language</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>response-expires</code>

 *
 * <code>response-content-disposition</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>response-content-encoding</code>
 *
 * </p </li> </ul>
 *
 * <b>Additional Considerations about Request Headers</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * If both of the <code>If-Match</code> and <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as follows:
 * <code>If-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, and; <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> condition
 * evaluates to <code>false</code>; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * If both of the <code>If-None-Match</code> and <code>If-Modified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as
 * follows:<code> If-None-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>, and; <code>If-Modified-Since</code>
 * condition evaluates to <code>true</code>; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response

 *
 * By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example,
 * lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the AWS account that created it)
 * can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access
 * policy. For this operation, a user must get the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration
 *
 * permission>
 *
 * You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes any other permissions. If you want to block
 * users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following
 *
 * actions> <ul> <li>
 *
 * s3:DeleteObjec> </li> <li>
 *
 * s3:DeleteObjectVersio> </li> <li>
 *
 * s3:PutLifecycleConfiguratio> </li> </ul>

 * Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the <code>website</code> subresource. To configure a bucket

 *
 * This PUT action requires the <code>S3:PutBucketWebsite</code> permission. By default, only the bucket owner can
 * configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website
 * configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them the <code>S3:PutBucketWebsite</code>
 *
 * permission>
 *
 * To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint, you add a website configuration with the

 *
 * Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to

 * it>
 *
 * Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the
 *
 * bucket>
 *
 * Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it
 * overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to
 * build it into your application layer or use versioning
 *
 * instead>
 *
 * To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the <code>Content-MD5</code> header. When you use this
 * header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error.
 * Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the
 * calculated MD5
 *
 * value> <note>
 *
 * The <code>Content-MD5</code> header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured
 * using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html">Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview</a> in
 * the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.
 *
 * </p </note>
 *
 * <b>Server-side Encryption</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
 * writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own
 * encryption key or use AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html">Using Server-Side
 *
 * Encryption</a>>
 *
 * If you request server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the
 * object-level. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html">Amazon
 * S3 Bucket Keys</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * <b>Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access
 * control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
 * by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> and <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html">Managing ACLs Using the REST API</a>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * <b>Storage Class Options</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class
 * provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage
 * Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html">Storage Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3
 * User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * <b>Versioning</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being
 * stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives
 * multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the
 *
 * objects>
 *
 * For more information about versioning, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html">Adding Objects to
 * Versioning Enabled Buckets</a>. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see <a

 *
 * </p
 *
 * You can set access permissions using one of the following
 *
 * methods> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known
 * as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the
 * value of <code>x-amz-ac</code>l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your
 * request. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned
 *
 * ACL</a>> </li> <li>
 *
 * Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>,
 * <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you
 * specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If
 * you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters
 * map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL)

 *
 * <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS
 *
 * accoun> </li> <li>

 * Define the SQL expression for the <code>SELECT</code> type of restoration for your query in the request body's
 * <code>SelectParameters</code> structure. You can use expressions like the following
 *
 * examples> <ul> <li>
 *
 * The following expression returns all records from the specified
 *
 * object>
 *
 * <code>SELECT * FROM Object</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional
 *
 * headers>
 *
 * <code>SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * If you have headers and you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> in the <code>CSV</code> structure in the request body to
 * <code>USE</code>, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> field to
 * <code>IGNORE</code>, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * <code>SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s</code>
 *
 * </p </li> </ul> </li> </ul>

 * Select and S3 Glacier Select</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * When making a select request, you can also do the
 *
 * following> <ul> <li>
 *
 * To expedite your queries, specify the <code>Expedited</code> tier. For more information about tiers, see "Restoring
 * Archives," later in this
 *
 * topic> </li> <li>
 *
 * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization
 * of the CSV-encoded query
 *
 * results> </li> </ul>
 *
 * The following are additional important facts about the select
 *
 * feature> <ul> <li>
 *
 * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly
 * deleted-manually or through a lifecycle
 *
 * policy> </li> <li>
 *
 * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so
 * avoid issuing duplicate
 *
 * requests> </li> <li>
 *
 * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error
 * response
 *
 * <code>409</code>> </li> </ul>
 *
 * <b>Restoring objects</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive
 * or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep
 * Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the
 * Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a
 * restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must
 * restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you
 *
 * specify>
 *
 * To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3
 * restores the current
 *
 * version>
 *
 * When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier
 * options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body:
 *
 * </p <ul> <li>
 *
 * <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier
 * storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are
 * required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made
 * available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available
 * when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier
 * Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive
 *
 * tier> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several
 * hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals
 * typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive
 * tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3
 * Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3
 *
 * Intelligent-Tiering> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to
 * retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for
 * objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48
 * hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk
 * retrievals are free for objects stored in S3
 *
 * Intelligent-Tiering> </li> </ul>
 *
 * For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access,
 * see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in
 * the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For
 * more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html">
 * Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the
 * <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use
 * Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring Amazon S3 Event
 * Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period.
 * Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data
 * transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore
 * request for the
 *
 * object>
 *
 * If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration
 * overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days,
 * but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about
 * lifecycle configuration, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

 * <b>Responses</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * A successful action returns either the <code>200 OK</code> or <code>202 Accepted</code> status code.

 * AWS provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally
 * identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects. These Lambda functions are available in the AWS Serverless
 * Application Repository, and can be selected through the AWS Management Console when you create your Object Lambda Access
 *
 * Point>
 *
 * Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service
 * using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically detects personally identifiable
 * information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in
 * your Amazon S3 bucket.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service
 * using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts personally identifiable
 * information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in
 * your Amazon S3 bucket.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects stored in
 * S3 in one of six compressed file formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.
 *
 * </p
