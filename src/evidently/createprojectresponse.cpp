 *  You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of

 *  You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment can test

 *  also provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing features and
