 *  You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of
 *  your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when to
 *  ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch

 * 
 *  You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment can test
 *  as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it using statistical methods. It
 *  also provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing features and
