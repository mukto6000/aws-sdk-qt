 * \class QtAws::OpsWorksCM::DescribeEventsRequest
 * \brief The DescribeEventsRequest class provides an interface for OpsWorksCM DescribeEvents requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsOpsWorksCM
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS OpsWorks CM</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS OpsWorks for configuration management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration management servers. You
 *  can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise
 *  servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to
 * 
 *  manage>
 * 
 *  <b>Glossary of terms</b>
 * 
 *  </p <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Server</b>: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs
 *  on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational
 *  Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that
 *  you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers,
 *  they continue to run until they are
 * 
 *  deleted> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Engine</b>: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release
 *  include <code>ChefAutomate</code> and
 * 
 *  <code>Puppet</code>> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM
 *  creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's
 *  configuration-related attributes at the time the backup
 * 
 *  starts> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run,
 *  when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are
 *  also
 * 
 *  deleted> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Account attributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These
 *  attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account.
 * 
 *  </p </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  <b>Endpoints</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your
 *  servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are
 * 
 *  created> <ul> <li>
