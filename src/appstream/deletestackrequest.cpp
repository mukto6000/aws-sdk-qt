 * 
 *  This is the <i>Amazon AppStream 2.0 API Reference</i>. This documentation provides descriptions and syntax for each of
 *  the actions and data types in AppStream 2.0. AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed, secure application streaming service that
 *  lets you stream desktop applications to users without rewriting applications. AppStream 2.0 manages the AWS resources
 *  that are required to host and run your applications, scales automatically, and provides access to your users on demand.
 * 
 *  </p <note>
 * 
 *  You can call the AppStream 2.0 API operations by using an interface VPC endpoint (interface endpoint). For more
 *  information, see <a
