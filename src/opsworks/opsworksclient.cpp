 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  When you call <a>CreateStack</a>, <a>CloneStack</a>, or <a>UpdateStack</a> we recommend you use the
 *  <code>ConfigurationManager</code> parameter to specify the Chef version. The recommended and default value for Linux
 *  stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html">Chef
 * 
 *  Versions</a>> <note>
 * 
 *  You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks to Chef
 *  12 as soon as
