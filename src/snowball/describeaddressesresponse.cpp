 *  The Amazon Web Services Snow Family provides a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to
 *  transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The
 *  Snow Family commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the Amazon Web
 *  Services Snow Family Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow Family device. To
 *  transfer data locally with a Snow Family device, you'll need to use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API
 *  Interface for Snowball or OpsHub for Snow Family. For more information, see the <a
