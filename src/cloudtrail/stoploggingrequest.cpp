 * 
 *  This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common

 * 
 *  CloudTrail>
 * 
 *  CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
 *  bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP
 *  address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the
 * 
 *  service> <note>
 * 
 *  As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various
 *  programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create
 *  programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing
 *  errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install
 *  them, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services
 * 
 *  page</a>> </note>
 * 
 *  See the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html">AWS CloudTrail
 *  User Guide</a> for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in the log
