 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsRolesAnywhere
 *
 *  AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for your workloads such as servers, containers,
 *  and applications running outside of AWS to obtain Temporary AWS credentials. Your workloads can use the same IAM
 *  policies and roles that you have configured with native AWS applications to access AWS resources. Using IAM Roles
 *  Anywhere will eliminate the need to manage long term credentials for workloads running outside of
 * 
 *  AWS>
 * 
 *  To use IAM Roles Anywhere customer workloads will need to use X.509 certificates issued by their Certificate Authority
 *  (CA) . The Certificate Authority (CA) needs to be registered with IAM Roles Anywhere as a trust anchor to establish
 *  trust between customer PKI and IAM Roles Anywhere. Customers who do not manage their own PKI system can use AWS
 *  Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (ACM PCA) to create a Certificate Authority and use that to establish
 *  trust with IAM Roles
 * 
 *  Anywher>
 * 
 *  This guide describes the IAM rolesanywhere operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about
 *  IAM Roles Anywhere see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/</a>
