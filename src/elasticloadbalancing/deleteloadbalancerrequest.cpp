 * \brief The DeleteLoadBalancerRequest class provides an interface for ElasticLoadBalancing DeleteLoadBalancer requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsElasticLoadBalancing
 *
 *  <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>
 * 
 *  A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the availability
 *  of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures that it routes
 *  traffic only to healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more
 *  listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer and a
 *  protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the
 * 
 *  instances>
 * 
 *  Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and
 *  Classic Load Balancers. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs. For more information, see the <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports Classic Load Balancers. The 2015-12-01 API supports Application
 *  Load Balancers and Network Load
 * 
 *  Balancers>
 * 
 *  To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using <a>CreateLoadBalancer</a>. Register your
 *  instances with the load balancer using
 * 
 *  <a>RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer</a>>
 * 
 *  All Elastic Load Balancing operations are <i>idempotent</i>, which means that they complete at most one time. If you
 *  repeat an operation, it succeeds with a 200 OK response
