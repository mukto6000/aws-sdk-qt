 *
 *  AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic
 *  cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection
 *  in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3) and to
 *  Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. A connection provides access to all AWS Regions
 *  except the China (Beijing) and (China) Ningxia Regions. AWS resources in the China Regions can only be accessed through
 *  locations associated with those
