 *
 *  Direct Connect links your internal network to an Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One
 *  end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you
 *  can create virtual interfaces directly to the Amazon Web Services Cloud (for example, to Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3) and
 *  to Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. A connection provides access to all Amazon Web
 *  Services Regions except the China (Beijing) and (China) Ningxia Regions. Amazon Web Services resources in the China
 *  Regions can only be accessed through locations associated with those
