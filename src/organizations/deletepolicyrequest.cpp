 *  <b>Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  For the current release of Organizations, specify the <code>us-east-1</code> region for all Amazon Web Services API and
 *  CLI calls made from the commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the Amazon Web
 *  Services Regions in China, then specify <code>cn-northwest-1</code>. You can do this in the CLI by using these
 *  parameters and
 * 
 *  commands> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its
 * 
 *  region>
 * 
 *  <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code> <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services
 *  Regions outside of China)</i>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  o>
 * 
 *  <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn</code> <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions
 *  in China)</i>
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this
 * 
 *  command>
 * 
 *  <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code> <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of
 *  China)</i>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  o>
 * 
 *  <code>aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1</code> <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i>
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Use the following parameter with each command to specify the
 * 
 *  endpoint>
 * 
 *  <code>--region us-east-1</code> <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)</i>
 * 
 *  </p
 *

 * 
 *  <b>Recording API Requests</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services
 *  account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine
 *  which requests the Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about
 *  Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration">Logging
 *  Organizations Events with CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide</i>. To learn more about CloudTrail,
 *  including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
