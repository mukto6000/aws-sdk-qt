 *
 *  AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an
 *  <i>organization</i> and centrally manage your accounts and their
 * 
 *  resources>
 * 
 *  This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For more information about using this service, see the
 *  <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html">AWS Organizations User

 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  <b>Support and feedback for AWS Organizations</b>

 *  <b>Endpoint to call When using the AWS CLI or the AWS SDK</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  For the current release of Organizations, specify the <code>us-east-1</code> region for all AWS API and AWS CLI calls
 *  made from the commercial AWS Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the AWS Regions in China, then specify
 *  <code>cn-northwest-1</code>. You can do this in the AWS CLI by using these parameters and
 * 
 *  commands> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its
 * 
 *  region>
 * 
 *  <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code> <i>(from commercial AWS Regions outside of
 *  China)</i>

 * 
 *  <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn</code> <i>(from AWS Regions in China)</i>

 * 
 *  Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this
 * 
 *  command>

 *  <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code> <i>(from commercial AWS Regions outside of China)</i>

 *  Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about AWS Organizations and its
