 *  Welcome to the Amazon AppFlow API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Amazon
 *  AppFlow API operations, data types, and errors.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data between software as a
 *  service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and Amazon Web Services like Amazon S3 and
 *  Amazon Redshift.

 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  Amazon AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for OAuth, and include applicable OAuth attributes (such as
 *  <code>auth-code</code> and <code>redirecturi</code>) with the connector-specific <code>ConnectorProfileProperties</code>
 *  when creating a new connector profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations. For example, Salesforce users can refer to
 *  the <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_authenticate.htm"> <i>Authorize Apps with OAuth</i>
