 *
 *  <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>
 * 
 *  A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase
 *  the availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures
 *  that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by
 *  specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to
 *  the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer
 *  to the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the health status of the
 * 
 *  targets>
 * 
 *  Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load
 *  Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This reference covers the following load balancer
 * 
 *  types> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and supports HTTP and
 * 
 *  HTTPS> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and supports TCP, TLS, and
 * 
 *  UDP> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer
 * 
 *  3)> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load
 *  Balancing User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at most one time. If you repeat an
