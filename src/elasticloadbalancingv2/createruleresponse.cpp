 *
 *  <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>
 * 
 *  A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase
 *  the availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures
 *  that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by
 *  specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to
 *  the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer
 *  to the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the health status of the
 * 
 *  targets>
 * 
 *  Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load
 *  Balancers, and Classic Load
 * 
 *  Balancers>
 * 
 *  An Application Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS). A Network
 *  Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions at the transport layer (TCP/TLS). Both Application Load
 *  Balancers and Network Load Balancers can route requests to one or more ports on each EC2 instance or container instance
 *  in your virtual private cloud
 * 
 *  (VPC)>
 * 
 *  A Classic Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions either at the transport layer (TCP/SSL) or the
 *  application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), and supports either EC2-Classic or a VPC. For more information, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  This reference covers the 2015-12-01 API, which supports Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. The
 *  2012-06-01 API supports Classic Load
 * 
 *  Balancers>
 * 
 *  To get started, complete the following
 * 
 *  tasks> <ol> <li>
 * 
 *  Create a load balancer using
 * 
 *  <a>CreateLoadBalancer</a>> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Create a target group using
 * 
 *  <a>CreateTargetGroup</a>> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Register targets for the target group using
 * 
 *  <a>RegisterTargets</a>> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Create one or more listeners for your load balancer using
 * 
 *  <a>CreateListener</a>> </li> </ol>
 * 
 *  To delete a load balancer and its related resources, complete the following
 * 
 *  tasks> <ol> <li>
 * 
 *  Delete the load balancer using
 * 
 *  <a>DeleteLoadBalancer</a>> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Delete the target group using
 * 
 *  <a>DeleteTargetGroup</a>> </li> </ol>
 * 
 *  All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at most one time. If you repeat an
 *  operation, it
