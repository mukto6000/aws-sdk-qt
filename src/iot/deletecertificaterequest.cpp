 *
 *  <fullname>IoT</fullname>
 * 
 *  IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators,
 *  embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint
 *  to communicate with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources
 *  associated with each device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to
 *  authenticate
 * 
 *  devices>
 * 
 *  The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html">Amazon Web Services IoT Core Endpoints and
 *  Quotas</a>. You must use the endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to
 * 
 *  access>
 * 
 *  The service name used by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon Web
 *  Services Signature Version 4</a> to sign the request is:
 * 
 *  <i>execute-api</i>>
 *
