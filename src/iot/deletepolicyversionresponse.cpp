 *  AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators,

 *  with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources associated with each
 *  device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate
 * 
 *  devices>
