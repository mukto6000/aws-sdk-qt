 *  With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory cache with less of the

 *  cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache

 *  In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance
 *  statistics associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs
