 * \class QtAws::MediaTailor::DeletePlaybackConfigurationRequest
 * \brief The DeletePlaybackConfigurationRequest class provides an interface for MediaTailor DeletePlaybackConfiguration requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsMediaTailor
 *
 *  Use the AWS Elemental MediaTailor SDKs and CLI to configure scalable ad insertion and linear channels. With MediaTailor,
 *  you can assemble existing content into a linear stream and serve targeted ads to viewers while maintaining broadcast
 *  quality in over-the-top (OTT) video applications. For information about using the service, including detailed
 *  information about the settings covered in this guide, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/">AWS Elemental MediaTailor User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  Through the SDKs and the CLI you manage AWS Elemental MediaTailor configurations and channels the same as you do through
 *  the console. For example, you specify ad insertion behavior and mapping information for the origin server and the ad
 *  decision server
