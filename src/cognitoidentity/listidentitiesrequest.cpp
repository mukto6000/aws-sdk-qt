 *  Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary credentials to mobile devices and

 *  application>
 * 
 *  Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more third-party identity providers
 *  (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support
 *  unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token
 *  provider trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS
 * 
 *  credentials>
