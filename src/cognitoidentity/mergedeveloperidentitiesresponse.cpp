 *  Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary credentials to mobile devices and
 *  other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the
 *  lifetime of an
 * 
 *  application>
 * 
 *  Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more third-party identity providers
 *  (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support
 *  unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token
 *  provider trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS
 * 
 *  credentials>
 *
