 *  Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP),
 *  File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of
 *  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon EFS. Additionally, you can use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) to
 *  transfer files into and out of Amazon S3. Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows
 *  to Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53
 *  so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it
 *  with Amazon Web Services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with Transfer
 *  Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set
