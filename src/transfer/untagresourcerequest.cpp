 *  AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP),
 *  File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of
 *  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer
 *  Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing
 *  changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS
 *  services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer Family is easy
 *  since there is no infrastructure to buy and set
