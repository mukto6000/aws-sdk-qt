 * Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to
 * modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn't preserved.
 * For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see <a

 *
 * Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code>
 *
 * operation> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Although you can customize the message headers when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, Amazon SES will
 * automatically apply its own <code>Message-ID</code> and <code>Date</code> headers; if you passed these headers when
 * creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES
 *
 * provides> </li> <li>
 *
 * If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to
 * specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can
 * pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>, <code>FromArn</code>, and/or <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or
 * you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw
 *
 * email> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN</code>
 *
 * </p </li> </ul> <b>
 *
 * Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the
 *
 * email> </b>
 *
 * If you only specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to
 * the same identity that you
 *
 * specified>
 *
 * For more information about sending authorization, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html">Using Sending Authorization with

 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC:
 * fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your <i>sending quota</i>).
 * For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see <a
