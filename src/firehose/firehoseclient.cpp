 *
 * Creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery
 *
 * stream>
 *
 * By default, you can create up to 50 delivery streams per AWS
 *
 * Region>
 *
 * This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial status of the delivery stream is
 * <code>CREATING</code>. After the delivery stream is created, its status is <code>ACTIVE</code> and it now accepts data.
 * Attempts to send data to a delivery stream that is not in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state cause an exception. To check the
 * state of a delivery stream, use
 *
 * <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>>
 *
 * A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records directly from providers using
 * <a>PutRecord</a> or <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, or it can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To
 * specify a Kinesis data stream as input, set the <code>DeliveryStreamType</code> parameter to
 * <code>KinesisStreamAsSource</code>, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and role ARN in the
 * <code>KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration</code>
 *
 * parameter>
 *
 * A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES, Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must
 * specify only one of the following destination configuration parameters: <code>ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration</code>,
 * <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration</code>,
 * <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code>, or
 *
 * <code>SplunkDestinationConfiguration</code>>
 *
 * When you specify <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, you can also provide the following optional values:
 * BufferingHints, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and <code>CompressionFormat</code>. By default, if no
 * <code>BufferingHints</code> value is provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever
 * condition is satisfied first. <code>BufferingHints</code> is a hint, so there are some cases where the service cannot
 * adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or
 * under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable
 * encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon
 *
 * S3>
 *
 * A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a
 *
 * destination> <ul> <li>
 *
 * An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location. Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data
 * to Amazon S3 and then uses <code>COPY</code> syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table. This is specified in the
 * <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code>
 *
 * parameter> </li> <li>
 *
 * The compression formats <code>SNAPPY</code> or <code>ZIP</code> cannot be specified in
 * <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> because the Amazon Redshift <code>COPY</code> operation
 * that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't support these compression
 *
 * formats> </li> <li>
 *
 * We strongly recommend that you use the user name and password you provide exclusively with Kinesis Data Firehose, and
 * that the permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift <code>INSERT</code>
 *
 * permissions> </li> </ul>
 *
 * Kinesis Data Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the destination. The role should allow the
 * Kinesis Data Firehose principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that allow the service to
 * deliver the data. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3">Grant Kinesis Data Firehose
