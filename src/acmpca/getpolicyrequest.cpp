 * \class QtAws::AcmPca::GetPolicyRequest
 * \brief The GetPolicyRequest class provides an interface for AcmPca GetPolicy requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsAcmPca
 *
 *  This is the <i>Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (PCA) API Reference</i>. It provides descriptions,
 *  syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing a private
 *  certificate authority (CA) for your
 * 
 *  organization>
 * 
 *  The documentation for each action shows the API request parameters and the JSON response. Alternatively, you can use one
 *  of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you
 *  prefer. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services
 * 
 *  SDKs</a>>
 * 
 *  Each ACM Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the number of times the operation can be called per
 *  second. ACM Private CA throttles API requests at different rates depending on the operation. Throttling means that ACM
 *  Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request exceeds the operation's quota for the number of
 *  requests per second. When a request is throttled, ACM Private CA returns a <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html">ThrottlingException</a> error. ACM
 *  Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request rate for APIs.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  To see an up-to-date list of your ACM Private CA quotas, or to request a quota increase, log into your Amazon Web
 *  Services account and visit the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/">Service Quotas</a>
