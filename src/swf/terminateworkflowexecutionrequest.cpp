 *  <fullname>Amazon Simple Workflow Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to
 *  coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a <i>task</i> represents a logical unit of work that is
 *  performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies,
 *  scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the
 * 
 *  application>
 * 
 *  Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying
 *  complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their
 * 
 *  state>
 * 
 *  This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the <i> <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/">Amazon SWF Developer Guide</a>
