 * \brief The EbsClient class provides access to the Amazon Elastic Block Store ( EBS) service.
 *
 * \ingroup aws-clients
 * \inmodule QtAwsEBS
 *
 *  You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to create EBS snapshots, write data directly to your
 *  snapshots, read data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between two snapshots. If youâ€™re an
 *  independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient
 *  and cost-effective to track incremental changes on your EBS volumes through snapshots. This can be done without having
 *  to create new volumes from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to compare the
 * 
 *  differences>
 * 
 *  You can create incremental snapshots directly from data on-premises into EBS volumes and the cloud to use for quick
 *  disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots, you can write your on-premises data to an EBS snapshot
 *  during a disaster. Then after recovery, you can restore it back to AWS or on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer
 *  need to build and maintain complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon
 * 
 *  EBS>
 * 
 *  This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the EBS direct
 *  APIs. For more information about the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use them
 *  effectively, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html">Accessing the
 *  Contents of an EBS Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>. For more information about the
 *  supported AWS Regions, endpoints, and service quotas for the EBS direct APIs, see <a
