 * \brief The LexRuntimeServiceClient class provides access to the Amazon Lex Runtime Service service.
 *
 * \ingroup aws-clients
 * \inmodule QtAwsLexRuntimeService
 *
 *  Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint provides a set of operations (API). Your
 *  conversational bot uses the runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For example, suppose a
 *  user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the
 *  user request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user
 *  conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust type), and
 *  then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create
 *  and manage your Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time API, .

 * Sends user input (text or speech) to Amazon Lex. Clients use this API to send text and audio requests to Amazon Lex at
 * runtime. Amazon Lex interprets the user input using the machine learning model that it built for the bot.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * The <code>PostContent</code> operation supports audio input at 8kHz and 16kHz. You can use 8kHz audio to achieve higher
 * speech recognition accuracy in telephone audio applications.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * In response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user. Consider the following example messages:
 *
 * </p <ul> <li>
 *
 * For a user input "I would like a pizza," Amazon Lex might return a response with a message eliciting slot data (for
 * example, <code>PizzaSize</code>): "What size pizza would you like?".
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * After the user provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon Lex might return a response with a message to get
 * user confirmation: "Order the pizza?".
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * After the user replies "Yes" to the confirmation prompt, Amazon Lex might return a conclusion statement: "Thank you,
 * your cheese pizza has been ordered.".
 *
 * </p </li> </ul>
 *
 * Not all Amazon Lex messages require a response from the user. For example, conclusion statements do not require a
 * response. Some messages require only a yes or no response. In addition to the <code>message</code>, Amazon Lex provides
 * additional context about the message in the response that you can use to enhance client behavior, such as displaying the
 * appropriate client user interface. Consider the following examples:
 *
 * </p <ul> <li>
 *
 * If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the following context information:
 *
 * </p <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-lex-dialog-state</code> header set to <code>ElicitSlot</code>
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-lex-intent-name</code> header set to the intent name in the current context
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit</code> header set to the slot name for which the <code>message</code> is eliciting
 * information
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>x-amz-lex-slots</code> header set to a map of slots configured for the intent with their current values
 *
 * </p </li> </ul> </li> <li>
 *
 * If the message is a confirmation prompt, the <code>x-amz-lex-dialog-state</code> header is set to
 * <code>Confirmation</code> and the <code>x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit</code> header is omitted.
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * If the message is a clarification prompt configured for the intent, indicating that the user intent is not understood,
 * the <code>x-amz-dialog-state</code> header is set to <code>ElicitIntent</code> and the <code>x-amz-slot-to-elicit</code>
 * header is omitted.
 *
 * </p </li> </ul>
 *
 * In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application-specific <code>sessionAttributes</code>. For more information, see
