 * \brief The DescribeReplayRequest class provides an interface for EventBridge DescribeReplay requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsEventBridge
 *
 *  Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your Amazon Web Services resources. When your resources
 *  change state, they automatically send events to an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the
 *  stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For
 *  example, you can configure rules
 * 
 *  to> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Automatically invoke an Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters
 *  the running
 * 
 *  state> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential security
 *  or availability
 * 
 *  risks> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS
 * 
 *  volume> </li> </ul>
 *
