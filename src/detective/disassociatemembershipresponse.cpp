 * \class QtAws::Detective::DisassociateMembershipResponse
 * \brief The DisassociateMembershipResponse class provides an interace for Detective DisassociateMembership responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsDetective
 *
 *  Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you analyze and investigate security issues
 *  across your Amazon Web Services (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login
 *  attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It
 *  also extracts findings detected by Amazon
 * 
 *  GuardDuty>
 * 
 *  The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the
 *  extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator
 * 
 *  account>
 * 
 *  Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage graphs that belong to the Region that
 *  is associated with the currently selected
 * 
 *  endpoint>
 * 
 *  A Detective administrator account can use the Detective API to do the
 * 
 *  following> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior
 * 
 *  graph> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  View the list of member accounts in a behavior
 * 
 *  graph> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Add member accounts to a behavior
 * 
 *  graph> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Remove member accounts from a behavior
 * 
 *  graph> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  A member account can use the Detective API to do the
 * 
 *  following> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited
 * 
 *  to> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior
 * 
 *  graph> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior
 * 
 *  graph> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Remove their account from a behavior
 * 
 *  graph> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging Detective API Calls
 *  with
 * 
 *  CloudTrail</a>> <note>
 * 
 *  We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An administrator account is used to
 *  centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their
 *  behavior
