 *  <fullname>AWS Health</fullname>
 * 
 *  The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health information that is presented in the <a
 *  href="https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/">AWS Personal Health Dashboard</a>. You can get information about events
 *  that affect your AWS
 * 
 *  resources> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DescribeEvents</a>: Summary information about
 * 
 *  events> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DescribeEventDetails</a>: Detailed information about one or more
 * 
 *  events> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DescribeAffectedEntities</a>: Information about AWS resources that are affected by one or more
 * 
 *  events> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  In addition, these operations provide information about event types and summary counts of events or affected
 * 
 *  entities> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DescribeEventTypes</a>: Information about the kinds of events that AWS Health
 * 
 *  tracks> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DescribeEventAggregates</a>: A count of the number of events that meet specified
 * 
 *  criteria> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DescribeEntityAggregates</a>: A count of the number of affected entities that meet specified
 * 
 *  criteria> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  The Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS
 *  Support</a>. Calling the Health API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan causes a
 *  <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code>.
 *

 * 
 *  For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the <a

 * 
 *  Process</a>>
 * 
 *  See the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html">AWS Health User Guide</a> for
