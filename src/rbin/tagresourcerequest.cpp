 *  Recycle Bin is a resource recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally deleted snapshots and EBS-backed
 *  AMIs. When using Recycle Bin, if your resources are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that
 *  you
 * 
 *  specify>
 * 
 *  You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention period expires. After you restore a
 *  resource from the Recycle Bin, the resource is removed from the Recycle Bin, and you can then use it in the same way you
 *  use any other resource of that type in your account. If the retention period expires and the resource is not restored,
 *  the resource is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and is no longer available for recovery. For more information
 *  about Recycle Bin, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-recycle-bin.html"> Recycle
