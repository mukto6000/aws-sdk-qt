 * \class QtAws::Athena::StartQueryExecutionRequest
 * \brief The StartQueryExecutionRequest class provides an interface for Athena StartQueryExecution requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsAthena
 *
 *  Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You
 *  can point Athena at your data in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so
 *  there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only for the queries you run. Athena scales
 *  automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For more
 *  information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html">What is Amazon Athena</a> in the
 *  <i>Amazon Athena User
 * 
 *  Guide</i>>
 * 
 *  If you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use version 1.1.0 of the driver or later with the Amazon Athena API.
 *  Earlier version drivers do not support the API. For more information and to download the driver, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html">Accessing Amazon Athena with
 * 
 *  JDBC</a>>
 * 
 *  For code samples using the Amazon Web Services SDK for Java, see <a
