 * \brief The DescribeServicesResponse class provides an interace for Pricing DescribeServices responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsPricing
 *
 *  AWS Price List Service API (AWS Price List Service) is a centralized and convenient way to programmatically query Amazon
 *  Web Services for services, products, and pricing information. The AWS Price List Service uses standardized product
 *  attributes such as <code>Location</code>, <code>Storage Class</code>, and <code>Operating System</code>, and provides
 *  prices at the SKU level. You can use the AWS Price List Service to build cost control and scenario planning tools,
 *  reconcile billing data, forecast future spend for budgeting purposes, and provide cost benefit analysis that compare
 *  your internal workloads with
 * 
 *  AWS>
 * 
 *  Use <code>GetServices</code> without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all AWS services, then
 *  <code>GetServices</code> with a service code to retreive the attribute names for that service. After you have the
 *  service code and attribute names, you can use <code>GetAttributeValues</code> to see what values are available for an
 *  attribute. With the service code and an attribute name and value, you can use <code>GetProducts</code> to find specific
 *  products that you're interested in, such as an <code>AmazonEC2</code> instance, with a <code>Provisioned IOPS</code>
 * 
 *  <code>volumeType</code>>
