 * \inmodule QtAwsGlacier
 *
 *  Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for "cold
 * 
 *  data.>
 * 
 *  Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup
 *  and archival. With Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Glacier also
 *  enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to
 *  worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming
 *  hardware
 * 
 *  migrations>
 * 
 *  Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and your data is rarely retrieved. If your
 *  application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see <a
 *  href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
 * 
 *  S3)</a>>
 * 
 *  You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in
 * 
 *  Glacier>
 * 
 *  If you are a first-time user of Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the <i>Amazon
 *  S3 Glacier Developer
 * 
 *  Guide</i>> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html">What is Amazon S3 Glacier</a> - This
