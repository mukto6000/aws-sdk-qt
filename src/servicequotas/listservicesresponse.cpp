 *  Service Quotas is a web service that you can use to manage many of your AWS service quotas. Quotas, also referred to as
 *  limits, are the maximum values for a resource, item, or operation. This guide provide descriptions of the Service Quotas
 *  actions that you can call from an API. For the Service Quotas user guide, which explains how to use Service Quotas from
 *  the console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html">What is Service
 *  Quotas</a>.
 * 
 *  </p <note>
 * 
 *  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET,
 *  iOS, Android, etc...,). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Service Quotas and AWS. For
 *  information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the <a
