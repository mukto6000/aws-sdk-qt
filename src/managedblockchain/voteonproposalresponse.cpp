 *  Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and managing blockchain networks using open-source

 *  transactions and share data without the need for a trusted, central
 * 
 *  authority>
 * 
 *  Managed Blockchain supports the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum open-source frameworks. Because of fundamental
 *  differences between the frameworks, some API actions or data types may only apply in the context of one framework and
 *  not the other. For example, actions related to Hyperledger Fabric network members such as <code>CreateMember</code> and
 *  <code>DeleteMember</code> do not apply to
 * 
 *  Ethereum>
 * 
 *  The description for each action indicates the framework or frameworks to which it applies. Data types and properties
 *  that apply only in the context of a particular framework are similarly
