 *
 * If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the
 *
 * chain> </li> <li>
 *
 * The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be
 *
 * PEM-encoded> </li> <li>
 *
 * The current time must be between the <code>Not Before</code> and <code>Not After</code> certificate
 *
 * fields> </li> <li>
 *
 * The <code>Issuer</code> field must not be
 *
 * empty> </li> <li>
 *
 * The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000
 *
 * characters> </li> <li>
 *
 * To import a new certificate, omit the <code>CertificateArn</code> argument. Include this argument only when you want to
 * replace a previously imported
 *
 * certificate> </li> <li>
 *
 * When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private
 * key by their file names preceded by <code>file://</code>. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the
 * <code>C:\temp</code> folder as <code>file://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem</code>. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS
 * Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs.
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
