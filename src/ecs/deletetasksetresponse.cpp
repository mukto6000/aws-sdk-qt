 *  <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it
 *  easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure
 *  that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on AWS Fargate. For more control, you can host your
 *  tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you
 * 
 *  manage>
 * 
 *  Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the
 *  state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2
 * 
 *  features>
 * 
 *  You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs,
 *  isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster
 *  management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management
