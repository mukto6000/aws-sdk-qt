 *  <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service. It makes it easy
 *  to run, stop, and manage Docker containers. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that's managed by
 *  Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of
 *  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or External (on-premises) instances that you
 * 
 *  manage>
 * 
 *  Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls. This makes it easy to
 *  get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2
 * 
 *  features>
 * 
 *  You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs,
 *  isolation policies, and availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you don't need to operate your own cluster
 *  management and configuration management systems. You also don't need to worry about scaling your management
