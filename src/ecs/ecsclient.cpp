 *  <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it
 *  easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure
 *  that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you
 *  can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using the EC2
 *  launch type. For more information about launch types, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html">Amazon ECS Launch
 * 
 *  Types</a>>
 * 
 *  Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of
 *  your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2
 * 
 *  features>
 * 
 *  You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs,
 *  isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster
 *  management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management

 * Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a
 * service drops below the <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns another copy of the task in the specified cluster.
 * To update an existing service, see
 *
 * <a>UpdateService</a>>
 *
 * In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load
 * balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more
 * information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html">Service Load
 * Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code>
 * state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the
 * <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as healthy by the load
 *
 * balancer>
 *
 * There are two service scheduler strategies
 *
 * available> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>REPLICA</code> - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your
 * cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement
 * strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in
 * the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>DAEMON</code> - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that
 * meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. When using this strategy, you don't need
 * to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more
 * information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Service
 * Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>> </li> </ul>
 *
 * You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing
 * properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation. The
 * default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 100%. The default value for a daemon
 * service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is
 *
 * 0%>
 *
 * If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit
 * on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment, as a
 * percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in
 * the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to
 * deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a
 * minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting
 * two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the
 * <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in
 * the <code>RUNNING</code> state and they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum
 * healthy percent is
 *
 * 100%>
 *
 * If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the <b>maximum percent</b> parameter represents an
 * upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code>
 * state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and
 * while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch
 * type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number
 * of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older
 * tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is
 *
 * 200%>
 *
 * If a service is using either the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types and tasks
 * that use the EC2 launch type, the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> and <b>maximum percent</b> values are used only to
 * define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state
 * while the container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch
 * type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used, although they're currently visible when
 * describing your
 *
 * service>
 *
 * When creating a service that uses the <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that
 * aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services
 * using the <a>CreateTaskSet</a> operation. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html">Amazon ECS Deployment Types</a>
 * in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following
 *
 * logic> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they
 * have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance
 *
 * attributes)> </li> <li>
 *
 * By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can
 * choose a different placement strategy) with the <code>placementStrategy</code>
 *
 * parameter)> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this
 * service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C
 * each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for
 *
 * placement> </li> <li>
 *
 * Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps),
 * favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this

 *
 * The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task
