 * \class QtAws::IAM::AttachGroupPolicyResponse
 * \brief The AttachGroupPolicyResponse class provides an interace for IAM AttachGroupPolicy responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsIAM
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS Identity and Access Management</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can use to manage users and user permissions under
 *  your AWS account. This guide provides descriptions of IAM actions that you can call programmatically. For general
 *  information about IAM, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>. For the
 *  user guide for IAM, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">Using IAM</a>.
 * 
 *  </p <note>
 * 
 *  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby,
 *  .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM and AWS. For example,
 *  the SDKs take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying
 *  requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the <a
 *  href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a> page.
 * 
 *  </p </note>
 * 
 *  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM. However, you can also use the IAM Query
 *  API to make direct calls to the IAM web service. To learn more about the IAM Query API, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html">Making Query Requests</a> in the <i>Using
 *  IAM</i> guide. IAM supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for
 *  some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for
 *  operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  <b>Signing Requests</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your
 *  AWS account access key ID and secret access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the access key ID and secret
 *  access key for an IAM user or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials and
 *  use those to sign
 * 
 *  requests>
 * 
 *  To sign requests, we recommend that you use <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>. If you have an
 *  existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However,
 *  some operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require version 4 indicate this
 *  requirement.
 *
