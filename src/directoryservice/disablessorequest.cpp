 *  AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the AWS cloud, or
 *  connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides detailed

 *  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby,
 *  .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Directory Service and
