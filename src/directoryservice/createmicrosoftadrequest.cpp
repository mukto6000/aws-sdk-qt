 *  Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the Amazon Web Services
 *  cloud, or connect your Amazon Web Services resources with an existing self-managed Microsoft Active Directory. This
 *  guide provides detailed information about Directory Service operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For

 *  Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and
 *  platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
 *  Directory Service and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs,
