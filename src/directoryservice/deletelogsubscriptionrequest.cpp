 *  AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the AWS cloud, or
 *  connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides detailed

 *  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby,
