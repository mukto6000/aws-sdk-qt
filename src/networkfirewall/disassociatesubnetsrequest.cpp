 * \class QtAws::NetworkFirewall::DisassociateSubnetsRequest
 * \brief The DisassociateSubnetsRequest class provides an interface for NetworkFirewall DisassociateSubnets requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsNetworkFirewall
 *
 *  This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the
 *  Network Firewall API actions, data types, and errors.
 * 
 *  </p <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and
 *  error handling. For general information about using the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html">Amazon Web Services APIs</a>.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  To access Network Firewall using the REST API endpoint: <code>https://network-firewall.<region>.amazonaws.com </code>
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming
 *  language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web
 *  Services
 * 
 *  SDKs</a>> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the
 *  Network Firewall console, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/">Network
 *  Firewall Developer
 * 
 *  Guide</a>> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for Amazon
 *  Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This
 *  includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect.
 *  Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source intrusion detection system (IDS)
 *  engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version 5.0.2. For information about Suricata, see the <a
 *  href="https://suricata-ids.org/">Suricata
 * 
 *  website</a>>
 * 
 *  You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of ways. The following are just a few
 *  examples:
 * 
 *  </p <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Allow domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other
 *  forms of
 * 
 *  traffic> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can
 * 
 *  access> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your
 * 
 *  VPC> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless of the port
 * 
 *  used> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network Firewall. For information
 *  about using Amazon VPC, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/">Amazon VPC User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  To start using Network Firewall, do the following:
 * 
 *  </p <ol> <li>
 * 
 *  (Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create it in Amazon VPC.
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of
 *  Network Firewall.
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the components of the network traffic
 *  filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have.
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional default traffic
 *  filtering behavior.
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a
 *  firewall endpoint in each subnet that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall
 * 
 *  policy> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through the new firewall
