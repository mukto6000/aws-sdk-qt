 *
 *  AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) helps you securely create, or connect, your workforce
 *  identities and manage their access centrally across AWS accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is the
 *  recommended approach for workforce authentication and authorization in AWS, for organizations of any size and

 *  type> <note>
 * 
 *  Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will
 *  continue to retain their original name for backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM Identity Center
 * 
 *  rename</a>> </note>
 * 
 *  This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which could be used for access management of AWS
 *  accounts. For information about IAM Identity Center features, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">IAM Identity Center User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as principals. For more
 *  information about how to work with principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html">Identity Store API

 *  Reference</a>> <note>
 * 
 *  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby,
 *  .Net, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity Center
 *  and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
