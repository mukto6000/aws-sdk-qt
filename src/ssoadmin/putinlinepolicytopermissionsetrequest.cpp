 *  AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) helps you securely create, or connect, your workforce

 * 
 *  Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will

 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">IAM Identity Center User

 *  Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as principals. For more

 *  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby,
 *  .Net, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity Center
