 *
 *  Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS
 *  without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for
 *  automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and
 *  tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running
 *  on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that
 *  you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification
