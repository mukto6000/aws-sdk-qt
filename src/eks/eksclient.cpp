 * \ingroup aws-clients
 * \inmodule QtAwsEKS
 *
 *  Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS
 *  without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for
 *  automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and
 *  tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running
 *  on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that
 *  you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification

 * Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, such as
 * <code>etcd</code> and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by AWS, and the Kubernetes API is
 * exposed via the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single-tenant and unique and
 * runs on its own set of Amazon EC2
 *
 * instances>
 *
 * The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing
 * Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity
 * from the control plane instances to the worker nodes (for example, to support <code>kubectl exec</code>,
 * <code>logs</code>, and <code>proxy</code> data
 *
 * flows)>
 *
 * Amazon EKS worker nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's control plane via the Kubernetes API
 * server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your
 *
 * cluster>
 *
 * You can use the <code>endpointPublicAccess</code> and <code>endpointPrivateAccess</code> parameters to enable or disable
 * public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and
 * private access is disabled. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html">Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access
 * Control</a> in the <i> <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i> </i>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * You can use the <code>logging</code> parameter to enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your
 * cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more
 * information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html">Amazon EKS Cluster
 * Control Plane Logs</a> in the <i> <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i>

 * CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates apply to exported control plane logs. For more
 * information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">Amazon CloudWatch
 *

 *
 * Cluster creation typically takes between 10 and 15 minutes. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure
 * your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch worker nodes into your cluster. For more
 * information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-auth.html">Managing Cluster
