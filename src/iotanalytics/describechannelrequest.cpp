 * \class QtAws::IoTAnalytics::DescribeChannelRequest
 * \brief The DescribeChannelRequest class provides an interface for IoTAnalytics DescribeChannel requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsIoTAnalytics
 *
 *  IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data, process messages, and store them. You can then query
 *  the data and run sophisticated analytics on it. IoT Analytics enables advanced data exploration through integration with
 *  Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration with Amazon
 * 
 *  QuickSight>
 * 
 *  Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process structured data. IoT data often comes from
 *  devices that record noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result the data from these devices can
 *  have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also,
 *  IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data from external sources.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices. IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and
 *  enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You can set up the service to collect only
 *  the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and enrich the data with
 *  device-specific metadata such as device type and location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running
 *  queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference. IoT
 *  Analytics includes pre-built models for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices are about to
 *  fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning their wearable
