 *
 * Retrieve the MPEG-DASH URL using <code>GetDASHStreamingSessionURL</code>. Kinesis Video Streams creates an MPEG-DASH
 * streaming session to be used for accessing content in a stream using the MPEG-DASH protocol.
 * <code>GetDASHStreamingSessionURL</code> returns an authenticated URL (that includes an encrypted session token) for the
 * session's MPEG-DASH <i>manifest</i> (the root resource needed for streaming with
 *
 * MPEG-DASH)> <note>
 *
 * Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity can access it. The token provides access to the content of
 * the stream. Safeguard the token with the same measures that you use with your AWS
 *
 * credentials> </note>
 *
 * The media that is made available through the manifest consists only of the requested stream, time range, and format. No
 * other media data (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates) is made
 *
 * available> </li> <li>
 *
 * Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the MPEG-DASH manifest to a media player that supports the
 * MPEG-DASH protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the initialization fragment and media fragments available through the
 * manifest URL. The initialization fragment contains the codec private data for the stream, and other data needed to set
 * up the video or audio decoder and renderer. The media fragments contain encoded video frames or encoded audio
 *
 * samples> </li> <li>
 *
 * The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream metadata and media data normally. When the media
 * player requests data, it calls the following
 *
 * actions> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <b>GetDASHManifest:</b> Retrieves an MPEG DASH manifest, which contains the metadata for the media that you want to
 *
 * playback> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>GetMP4InitFragment:</b> Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment. The media player typically loads the
 * initialization fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment contains the "<code>fytp</code>" and
 * "<code>moov</code>" MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are needed to initialize the media player
 *
 * decoder>
 *
 * The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec
 * private data for the stream and respective track, which the media player needs to decode the media
 *
 * frames> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>GetMP4MediaFragment:</b> Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These fragments contain the "<code>moof</code>" and
 * "<code>mdat</code>" MP4 atoms and their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment's media frames and their
 * timestamps.
 *
 * </p <note>
 *
 * After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming session, any fragments that don't contain the same codec
 * private data cause an error to be returned when those different media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec private
 * data should not change between fragments in a session. This also means that the session fails if the fragments in a
 * stream change from having only video to having both audio and
 *
 * video> </note>
 *
