 *  Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) for developers who
 *  need to build websites or web applications. It includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances
 *  (virtual private servers), container services, storage buckets, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP
 *  addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and
 *  resource snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly
 * 
 *  price>
 * 
 *  You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS
 *  CLI), or SDKs. For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the <a
