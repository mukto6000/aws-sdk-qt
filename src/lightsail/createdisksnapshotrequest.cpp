 * \class QtAws::Lightsail::CreateDiskSnapshotRequest
 * \brief The CreateDiskSnapshotRequest class provides an interface for Lightsail CreateDiskSnapshot requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsLightsail
 *
 *  Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers who just need virtual private servers.
 *  Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, a managed database, SSD-based
 *  storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You manage those Lightsail
 *  servers through the Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line interface
 * 
 *  (CLI)>
 * 
 *  For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the <a
 *  href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/all">Lightsail Dev
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  To use the Lightsail API or the CLI, you will need to use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to generate access
 *  keys. For details about how to set this up, see the <a
 *  href="http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli">Lightsail
