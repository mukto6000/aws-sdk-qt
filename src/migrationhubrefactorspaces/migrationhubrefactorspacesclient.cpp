 *
 * Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces route. The account owner of the service resource is always
 * the environment owner, regardless of which account creates the route. Routes target a service in the application. If an
 * application does not have any routes, then the first route must be created as a <code>DEFAULT</code>
 *
 * <code>RouteType</code>>
 *
 * When created, the default route defaults to an active state so state is not a required input. However, like all other
 * state values the state of the default route can be updated after creation, but only when all other routes are also
 * inactive. Conversely, no route can be active without the default route also being
 *
 * active>
 *
 * When you create a route, Refactor Spaces configures the Amazon API Gateway to send traffic to the target service as
 *
 * follows> <ul> <li>
 *
 * If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a private IP address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic
 * using the API Gateway VPC link.
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a public IP address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic over
 * the public
 *
 * internet> </li> <li>
 *
 * If the service has an Lambda function endpoint, then Refactor Spaces configures the Lambda function's resource policy to
 * allow the application's API Gateway to invoke the
 *
 * function> </li> </ul>
 *
 * A one-time health check is performed on the service when either the route is updated from inactive to active, or when it
 * is created with an active state. If the health check fails, the route transitions the route state to
 * <code>FAILED</code>, an error code of <code>SERVICE_ENDPOINT_HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURE</code> is provided, and no traffic is
 * sent to the
 *
 * service>
 *
 * For Lambda functions, the Lambda function state is checked. If the function is not active, the function configuration is
 * updated so that Lambda resources are provisioned. If the Lambda state is <code>Failed</code>, then the route creation
 * fails. For more information, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunctionConfiguration.html#SSS-GetFunctionConfiguration-response-State">GetFunctionConfiguration's
 * State response parameter</a> in the <i>Lambda Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * For Lambda endpoints, a check is performed to determine that a Lambda function with the specified ARN exists. If it does
 * not exist, the health check fails. For public URLs, a connection is opened to the public endpoint. If the URL is not
 * reachable, the health check fails.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For private URLS, a target group is created on the Elastic Load Balancing and the target group health check is run. The
 * <code>HealthCheckProtocol</code>, <code>HealthCheckPort</code>, and <code>HealthCheckPath</code> are the same protocol,
 * port, and path specified in the URL or health URL, if used. All other settings use the default values, as described in
 * <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html">Health
 * checks for your target groups</a>. The health check is considered successful if at least one target within the target
 * group transitions to a healthy
