 * \inmodule QtAwsCloudWatch
 *
 *  Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) resources and the applications you run on
 *  Amazon Web Services in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want
 *  to measure for your resources and
 * 
 *  applications>
 * 
 *  CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you
 *  define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use
 *  this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this
 *  data to stop under-used instances to save
 * 
 *  money>
 * 
 *  In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web Services, you can monitor your own custom
 *  metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
 *  operational
