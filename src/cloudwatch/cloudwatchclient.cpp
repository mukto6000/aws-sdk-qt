 *
 *  Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time.
 *  You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and
 * 
 *  applications>
 * 
 *  CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you
 *  define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use
 *  this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this
 *  data to stop under-used instances to save
 * 
 *  money>
 * 
 *  In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With

 *
 * It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and
 * composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part
 * of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to
 *
 * delete>
 *
 * To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the
 * cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the
 * <code>AlarmRule</code> of one of the alarms to <code>False</code>.

 *
 * Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.
