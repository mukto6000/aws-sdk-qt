 *
 *  AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for developers,
 *  scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy
 *  lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch will be familiar to users of traditional
 *  batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to
 *  eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results
 * 
 *  quickly>
 * 
 *  As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch computing workloads of
 *  any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the
 *  quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing software,
 *  which allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational complexities, saves
 *  time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in the
 *  AWS
