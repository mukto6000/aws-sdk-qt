 * \inmodule QtAwsBatch
 *
 *  AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for developers,
 *  scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy
 *  lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch will be familiar to users of traditional
 *  batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to
 *  eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results
 * 
 *  quickly>
 * 
 *  As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch computing workloads of
 *  any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the
 *  quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing software,
 *  which allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational complexities, saves
 *  time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in the
 *  AWS

 *
 * In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the
 * environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">launch template</a> that you
 * specify when you create the compute environment. You can choose to use Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances or Spot Instances
 * in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the
 * Spot Instance price is below a specified percentage of the On-Demand
 *
 * price> <note>
 *
 * Multi-node parallel jobs are not supported on Spot
 *
 * Instances> </note>
 *
 * In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own compute resources. This provides more compute resource
 * configuration options, such as using a custom AMI, but you must ensure that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container
 * instance AMI specification. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html">Container Instance
 * AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. After you have created your unmanaged compute
 * environment, you can use the <a>DescribeComputeEnvironments</a> operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that is
 * associated with it. Then, manually launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information,
 * see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html">Launching an
 * Amazon ECS Container Instance</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>> <note>
 *
 * AWS Batch does not upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it is created (for example, when a newer version of
 * the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI is available). You are responsible for the management of the guest operating system
 * (including updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the
