 *  <fullname>Batch</fullname>
 * 
 *  Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means
 *  for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of
 *  this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
 *  infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these advantages,
 *  Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively helping you to
 *  eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more
 * 
 *  quickly>
 * 
 *  As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically provisions compute
 *  resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With Batch,
 *  there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus your time and energy on
 *  analyzing results and solving your specific
