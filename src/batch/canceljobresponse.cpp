 *
 *  Using AWS Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for
 *  developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch uses the advantages of
 *  this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
 *  infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these advantages,
 *  AWS Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively helping you to
 *  eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more
 * 
 *  quickly>
 * 
 *  As a fully managed service, AWS Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions
 *  compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With
 *  AWS Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus your time and
 *  energy on analyzing results and solving your specific
