 *  <fullname>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services
 *  Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications
 *  faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon
 *  Web Services Cloud where you can launch Amazon Web Services resources in a virtual network that you've defined. Amazon
 *  Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly
 *  available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance and used like a hard
 * 
 *  drive>
