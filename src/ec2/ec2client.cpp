 *  <fullname>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services
 *  Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications
 *  faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon
 *  Web Services Cloud where you can launch Amazon Web Services resources in a virtual network that you've defined. Amazon
 *  Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly
 *  available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance and used like a hard
 * 
 *  drive>

 * issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this
 * occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the

 *
 * <i>Status</i>: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are <code>ok</code>, <code>impaired</code>
 * , <code>warning</code>, or <code>insufficient-data</code>. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is
 * <code>ok</code>. If the check fails, the overall status is <code>impaired</code>. If the status is

 *
 * <i>Events</i>: Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to take action. For example, if your volume
 * returns an <code>impaired</code> status, then the volume event might be <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>. This
 * means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and
 * might have inconsistent
 *
 * data>
 *
 * <i>Actions</i>: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the
 * volume is <code>impaired</code> and the volume event shows <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>, then the action
 * shows <code>enable-volume-io</code>. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling
