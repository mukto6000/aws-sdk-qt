 * When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status

 *
 * If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is
 * dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the
 * match or failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>, and processing is terminated. For

 * <b>This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from
 * a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response,
 * GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in <code>CLAIMED</code> status for 60 seconds, and returns
 * connection information that players can use to connect to the game server.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach
 * bypasses GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start
 * of a game session, such as a game map or player information.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization
 * status remains <code>AVAILABLE</code> while the claim status is set to <code>CLAIMED</code> for up to 60 seconds. This
 * time period gives the game server time to update its status to <code>UTILIZED</code> (using <a>UpdateGameServer</a>)
 * once players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed
 * status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not
 *
 * configurable>
 *
 * If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following
 *
 * cases> <ul> <li>
 *
 * If the game server utilization status is
 *
 * <code>UTILIZED</code>> </li> <li>
 *
 * If the game server claim status is
 *
 * <code>CLAIMED</code>> </li> </ul> <note>
 *
 * When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if the game server is running on an instance in

 * Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a
 * level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when
 * updating your game build.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an
 * active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active
 * fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct
 * players to an upgrade site.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point
 * to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an
 * alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling
 *
 * <code>UpdateAlias</code>>

 * command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and
 * (2) it creates a new build resource.
 *
 * </p </b>
 *
 * The <code>CreateBuild</code> operation can used in the following
 *
 * scenarios> <ul> <li>
 *
 * To create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3 location under an Amazon Web Services account that
 * you control. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in
 * place, call <code>CreateBuild</code> and specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of
 * your game
 *
 * build> </li> <li>
 *
 * To directly upload your build files to a GameLift Amazon S3 location. To use this option, first call
 * <code>CreateBuild</code> and specify a build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and
 * also returns an Amazon S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build
 * files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html">Uploading Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3
 * Developer Guide</i>. Build files can be uploaded to the GameLift Amazon S3 location once only; that can't be updated.
 *
 * </p </li> </ul>
 *
 * If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique build ID and places it in
 * <code>INITIALIZED</code> status. A build must be in <code>READY</code> status before you can create fleets with
 *
 * it>

 * Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) instances to host your custom game server
 * or Realtime Servers. Use this operation to configure the computing resources for your fleet and provide instructions for
 * running game servers on each
 *
 * instance>
 *
 * Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home Region (where the fleet is created)
 * and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following Amazon Web Services Regions support
 * multiple locations: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland),
 * ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets that are created in other GameLift
 * Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless
 * of location; however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each
 *
 * location>
 *
 * To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and
 * provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set
 * permissions for inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When creating a
 * multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote
 *
 * locations>
 *
 * If you need to debug your fleet, fetch logs, view performance metrics or other actions on the fleet, create the
 * development fleet with port 22/3389 open. As a best practice, we recommend opening ports for remote access only when you
 * need them and closing them when you're finished.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it in <code>NEW</code> status, which prompts
 * GameLift to initiate the <a

 * soon as the fleet status changes to <code>ACTIVE</code>, you can enable automatic scaling for the fleet with
 * <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> and set capacity for the home Region with <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>. When the status of each
 * remote location reaches <code>ACTIVE</code>, you can set capacity by location using

 *
 * Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
 * instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your Amazon
 * Web Services account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups
 * in the GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon
 *
 * CloudWatch>
 *
 * Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:
 *
 * </p <ul> <li>
 *
 * An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances with
 * your game server build. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html"> Launching an Instance from a
 * Launch Template</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * An IAM role that extends limited access to your Amazon Web Services account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and
 * interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html">Create IAM roles for
 * cross-service interaction</a> in the <i>GameLift FleetIQ Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>> </li> </ul>
 *
 * To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch
 * template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and
 * minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based
 * on a GameLift FleetIQ
 *
 * metric>
 *
 * Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto
 * Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including
 * maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind
 * that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities
 * to optimize for availability and
 *
 * cost>

 *
 * Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting
 * capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and
 * automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies:
 * target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is
 * the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy,
 * one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling
 * policies can have unintended
 *
 * consequences>
 *
 * You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action
 * AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop just one
 * scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with
 *
 * <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>>
 *
 * Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set Up Fleet Automatic
 *
 * Scaling</a>>
 *
 * <b>Target-based policy</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's
 * hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the
 * additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal
 * buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game
 * sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises
 * above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10%
 * buffer.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased".
 * Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your
 * desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling
 * policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are
 * temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are
 *
 * restarted>
 *
 * <b>Rule-based policy</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate
 * when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies
 * whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for
 * more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by
 *
 * 10%.>
 *
 * A policy's rule statement has the following
 *
 * structure>
 *
 * If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for
 * <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by
 *
 * <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>>
 *
 * To implement the example, the rule statement would look like
 *
 * this>
 *
 * If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code>
 * minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by
 *
 * <code>[10]</code>>
 *
 * To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to
 * "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is
 * returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's
 * auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are
 *
 * restarted>

 * Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill match process is essentially
 * identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the
 * original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this
 * information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling
 * this operation with a <a>GameSession</a> identifier. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from
 * your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the
 * <code>GameSession</code> resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill
 * match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a
 * time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier
 *
 * request>
 *
 * When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game
 * session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your
 * game can update the game session that is being
 *
 * backfilled>
 *
 * To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data
 * for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the <code>GameSession</code> ARN. If
 * successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill
 * tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new
 *
 * matches>
 *
 * Only game sessions created by FlexMatch are supported for match

 * Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules. With games that use
 * GameLift managed hosting, this operation also triggers GameLift to find hosting resources and start a new game session
 * for the new match. Each matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies the FlexMatch
 * matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to build a match that includes all players
 * in the request, placing them in the same team and finding additional players as needed to fill the match.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be
 * matched. You must also include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking configuration's rule set. If
 * successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>.
