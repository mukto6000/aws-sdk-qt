 *  <fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer
 *  games. Use Amazon GameLift for these tasks: (1) set up computing resources and deploy your game servers, (2) run game
 *  sessions and get players into games, (3) automatically scale your resources to meet player demand and manage costs, and
 *  (4) track in-depth metrics on game server performance and player
 * 
 *  usage>
 * 
 *  When setting up hosting resources, you can deploy your custom game server or use the Amazon GameLift Realtime Servers.
 *  Realtime Servers gives you the ability to quickly stand up lightweight, efficient game servers with the core Amazon
 *  GameLift infrastructure already built
