 *  <fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer
 *  games. Use Amazon GameLift for these tasks: (1) set up computing resources and deploy your game servers, (2) run game
 *  sessions and get players into games, (3) automatically scale your resources to meet player demand and manage costs, and
 *  (4) track in-depth metrics on game server performance and player
 * 
 *  usage>
 * 
 *  When setting up hosting resources, you can deploy your custom game server or use the Amazon GameLift Realtime Servers.
 *  Realtime Servers gives you the ability to quickly stand up lightweight, efficient game servers with the core Amazon
 *  GameLift infrastructure already built
 *

 *  matchmaking,
 * 
 *  etc> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Configure and manage game server resources -- Manage your Amazon GameLift hosting resources, including builds, scripts,
 *  fleets, queues, and aliases. Set up matchmakers, configure auto-scaling, retrieve game logs, and get hosting and game
 * 
 *  metrics> </li> </ul>
