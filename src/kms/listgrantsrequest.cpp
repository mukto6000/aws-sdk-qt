/*!
 * \class QtAws::Kms::ListGrantsRequest
 * \brief The ListGrantsRequest class provides an interface for Kms ListGrants requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsKms
 *
 *  <fullname>Key Management Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the KMS operations
 *  that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/"> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>
 * 
 *  </a>> <note>
 * 
 *  KMS is replacing the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not
 *  changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this
 * 
 *  term>
 * 
 *  Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and
 *  platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
 *  KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see
 *  below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs,
 *  including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 * 
 *  Services</a>> </note>
 * 
 *  We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web Services, use the FIPS
 *  endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region">Service endpoints</a> in the Key Management
 *  Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web Services General
 * 
 *  Reference</i>>
 * 
 *  All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends you always use
 *  the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as
 *  Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7
 *  and later support these
 * 
 *  modes>
 * 
 *  <b>Signing Requests</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you <i>do not</i>
 *  use your Amazon Web Services account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with KMS. Instead, use the
 *  access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to
 *  generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign
 * 
 *  requests>
 * 
 *  All KMS operations require <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
 *  Version
 * 
 *  4</a>>
 * 
 *  <b>Logging API Requests</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web
 *  Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by
 *  CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To
 *  learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>

 *  <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will
 *  likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the
 * 
 *  console> <ul> <li>
