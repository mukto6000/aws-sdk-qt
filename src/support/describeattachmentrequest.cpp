 *
 *  <fullname>AWS Support</fullname>
 * 
 *  The <i>AWS Support API Reference</i> is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support
 *  operations and data types. You can use the API to manage your support cases programmatically. The AWS Support API uses
 *  HTTP methods that return results in JSON
 * 
 *  format> <note> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the
 *  <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see
 *  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS
 * 
 *  Support</a>> </li> </ul> </note>
 * 
 *  The AWS Support service also exposes a set of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/">AWS Trusted
 *  Advisor</a> features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to
 *  refresh, and get the refresh status of
 * 
 *  checks>
 * 
 *  The following list describes the AWS Support case management
 * 
 *  operations> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels - The <a>DescribeServices</a> and
 *  <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem
 *  severity levels. You use these values when you call the <a>CreateCase</a>
 * 
 *  operation> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Case creation, case details, and case resolution - The <a>CreateCase</a>, <a>DescribeCases</a>,
 *  <a>DescribeAttachment</a>, and <a>ResolveCase</a> operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases,
 *  and resolve
 * 
 *  cases> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Case communication - The <a>DescribeCommunications</a>, <a>AddCommunicationToCase</a>, and <a>AddAttachmentsToSet</a>
 *  operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support
 * 
 *  cases> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted
 * 
 *  Advisor> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a> returns the list of checks that run against your AWS
 * 
 *  resources> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Using the <code>checkId</code> for a specific check returned by <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a>, you can call
 *  <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult</a> to obtain the results for the check that you
 * 
 *  specified> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries</a> returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor
 * 
 *  checks> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck</a> requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified
 * 
 *  check> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses</a> reports the refresh status of one or more
