 *  <fullname>App Runner</fullname>
 * 
 *  App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an
 *  existing container image or source code to a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in seconds. You don't need
 *  to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to provision and configure Amazon Web
 *  Services
 * 
 *  resources>
 * 
 *  App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery
 *  pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and
 * 
 *  security>
 * 
 *  For more information about App Runner, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/">App Runner
