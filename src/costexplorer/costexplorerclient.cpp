 * recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS
 * also shows the equal number of normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this
 * example, your RI recommendation would be for <code>c4.large</code> because that is the smallest size instance in the c4
