 * 
 *  CloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure deployments predictably and
 *  repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud,
 *  Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly
 *  reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying Amazon Web
 *  Services
 * 
 *  infrastructure>
 * 
 *  With CloudFormation, you declare all your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a
 *  collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the
 *  stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for
 * 
 *  you>
