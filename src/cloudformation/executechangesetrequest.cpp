 *  AWS CloudFormation allows you to create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can

 *  infrastructure>
 * 
 *  With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a
 *  collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of
