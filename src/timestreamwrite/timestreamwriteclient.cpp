 *  and maintenance. You can also store and analyze log data and metrics to improve the performance and availability of your
 *  applications. Timestream is built from the ground up to effectively ingest, process, and store time series data. It
 *  organizes data to optimize query processing. It automatically scales based on the volume of data ingested and on the
 *  query volume to ensure you receive optimal performance while inserting and querying data. As your data grows over time,

 * detects the column names and data types for your Timestream tables based on the dimension names and data types of the
 * data points you specify when invoking writes into the database. Timestream support eventual consistency read semantics.
 * This means that when you query data immediately after writing a batch of data into Timestream, the query results might
 * not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The results may also include some stale data. If you
 * repeat the query request after a short time, the results should return the latest data. <a

 * <b>Upserts</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * You can use the <code>Version</code> parameter in a <code>WriteRecords</code> request to update data points. Timestream
 * tracks a version number with each record. <code>Version</code> defaults to <code>1</code> when not specified for the
 * record in the request. Timestream will update an existing recordâ€™s measure value along with its <code>Version</code>
 * upon receiving a write request with a higher <code>Version</code> number for that record. Upon receiving an update
 * request where the measure value is the same as that of the existing record, Timestream still updates
 * <code>Version</code>, if it is greater than the existing value of <code>Version</code>. You can update a data point as
 * many times as desired, as long as the value of <code>Version</code> continuously increases.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For example, suppose you write a new record without indicating <code>Version</code> in the request. Timestream will
 * store this record, and set <code>Version</code> to <code>1</code>. Now, suppose you try to update this record with a
 * <code>WriteRecords</code> request of the same record with a different measure value but, like before, do not provide
 * <code>Version</code>. In this case, Timestream will reject this update with a <code>RejectedRecordsException</code>
 * since the updated recordâ€™s version is not greater than the existing value of Version. However, if you were to resend the
 * update request with <code>Version</code> set to <code>2</code>, Timestream would then succeed in updating the recordâ€™s
 * value, and the <code>Version</code> would be set to <code>2</code>. Next, suppose you sent a <code>WriteRecords</code>
 * request with this same record and an identical measure value, but with <code>Version</code> set to <code>3</code>. In
 * this case, Timestream would only update <code>Version</code> to <code>3</code>. Any further updates would need to send a
 * version number greater than <code>3</code>, or the update requests would receive a
 * <code>RejectedRecordsException</code>.
