 *  Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series database service that makes it easy to store and
 *  analyze trillions of time series data points per day. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze IoT sensor data
 *  to derive insights from your IoT applications. You can analyze industrial telemetry to streamline equipment management
 *  and maintenance. You can also store and analyze log data and metrics to improve the performance and availability of your
 *  applications. Timestream is built from the ground up to effectively ingest, process, and store time series data. It
 *  organizes data to optimize query processing. It automatically scales based on the volume of data ingested and on the
 *  query volume to ensure you receive optimal performance while inserting and querying data. As your data grows over time,
 *  Timestreamâ€™s adaptive query processing engine spans across storage tiers to provide fast analysis while reducing
