 *  AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests,
 *  and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your
 *  own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build
 *  tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use
 *  your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time
 *  you consume. For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the <i> <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodeBuild User Guide</a>.</i>
