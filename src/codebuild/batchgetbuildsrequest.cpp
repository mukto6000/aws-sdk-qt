 * \class QtAws::CodeBuild::BatchGetBuildsRequest
 * \brief The BatchGetBuildsRequest class provides an interface for CodeBuild BatchGetBuilds requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsCodeBuild
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS CodeBuild</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests,
 *  and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your
 *  own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build
 *  tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use
 *  your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time
 *  you consume. For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the <i>AWS CodeBuild User
 * 
 *  Guide</i>>
 * 
 *  AWS CodeBuild supports these
 * 
 *  operations> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>BatchDeleteBuilds</code>: Deletes one or more
 * 
 *  builds> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>BatchGetProjects</code>: Gets information about one or more build projects. A <i>build project</i> defines how AWS
 *  CodeBuild runs a build. This includes information such as where to get the source code to build, the build environment
 *  to use, the build commands to run, and where to store the build output. A <i>build environment</i> is a representation
 *  of operating system, programming language runtime, and tools that AWS CodeBuild uses to run a build. You can add tags to
 *  build projects to help manage your resources and
 * 
 *  costs> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>CreateProject</code>: Creates a build
 * 
 *  project> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>CreateWebhook</code>: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or
 *  Bitbucket repository, enables AWS CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to
 *  the
 * 
 *  repository> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>UpdateWebhook</code>: Changes the settings of an existing
 * 
 *  webhook> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>DeleteProject</code>: Deletes a build
 * 
 *  project> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>DeleteWebhook</code>: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or
 *  Bitbucket repository, stops AWS CodeBuild from rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the
 * 
 *  repository> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>ListProjects</code>: Gets a list of build project names, with each build project name representing a single build
 * 
 *  project> </li> <li>

 *  <code>ListBuilds</code>: Gets a list of build IDs, with each build ID representing a single

 *  <code>ListBuildsForProject</code>: Gets a list of build IDs for the specified build project, with each build ID
 *  representing a single
