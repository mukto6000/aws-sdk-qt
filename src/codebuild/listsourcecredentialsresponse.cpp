 * 
 *  CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and
 *  produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own
 *  build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools,
 *  such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild to use your own
 *  build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume.
 *  For more information about CodeBuild, see the <i> <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html">CodeBuild User Guide</a>.</i>
