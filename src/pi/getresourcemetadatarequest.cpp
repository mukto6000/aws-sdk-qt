 *  Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions of database load based on data
 *  captured from a running DB instance. The guide provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types,
 *  parameters and
 * 
 *  errors>
 * 
 *  When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance
 *  of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for Amazon Web Services service-vended
 *  monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB
 * 
 *  load>
 * 
 *  DB load is measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
 *  two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time
 *  range. Each time point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured at that time point.
 *  Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and
