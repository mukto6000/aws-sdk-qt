 *
 *  AWS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions of database load based on data captured
 *  from a running RDS instance. The guide provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types, parameters
 *  and errors. For more information about Performance Insights capabilities see <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html">Using Amazon RDS Performance
 *  Insights </a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User
 * 
 *  Guide</i>>
 * 
 *  The AWS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance of your RDS instance, when Performance
 *  Insights is enabled for supported engine types. While Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for AWS
 *  service vended monitoring metrics, AWS Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of database load measured as
 *  Average Active Sessions and provided to API consumers as a 2-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension of the
 *  data provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range, and each time point decomposes overall load in
 *  relation to the requested dimensions, such as SQL, Wait-event, User or Host, measured at that time
