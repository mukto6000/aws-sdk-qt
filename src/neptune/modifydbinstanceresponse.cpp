 * 
 *  Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run
 *  applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance
 *  graph database engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency.
 *  Amazon Neptune supports popular graph models Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective query languages Apache
 *  TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that efficiently navigate highly connected datasets.
 *  Neptune powers graph use cases such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and
 *  network

 * 
 *  This interface reference for Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can
 *  use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note that Amazon Neptune is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require
 *  techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the
 *  parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the
 *  maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user
