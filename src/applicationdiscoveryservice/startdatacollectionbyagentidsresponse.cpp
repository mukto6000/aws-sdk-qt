 * \class QtAws::ApplicationDiscoveryService::StartDataCollectionByAgentIdsResponse
 * \brief The StartDataCollectionByAgentIdsResponse class provides an interace for ApplicationDiscoveryService StartDataCollectionByAgentIds responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsApplicationDiscoveryService
 *
 *  <fullname>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects. It automatically
 *  identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more
 *  information, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">Amazon Web Services Application
 *  Discovery Service FAQ</a>. Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data
 *  about your on-premises
 * 
 *  servers> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Agentless discovery</b> is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you
 *  to install an agent on each host. It does not work in non-VMware
 * 
 *  environments> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required
 *  for initial on-premises infrastructure
 * 
 *  assessment> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that
 * 
 *  information> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Agent-based discovery</b> collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using the Amazon Web Services
 *  Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data
 * 
 *  center> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of running processes, system
 *  performance information, resource utilization, and network
 * 
 *  dependencies> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in
 *  the cloud.
 * 
 *  </p </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions</b> integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to
 *  import details of your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or
 *  discovery
 * 
 *  agent> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Third-party application discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service, and they can write
 *  to the Application Discovery Service database using the public
 * 
 *  API> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers and
 *  track
 * 
 *  migrations> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  <b>Recommendations</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and whenever you want to collect
 *  information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless
 *  discovery to complete the initial infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect
 *  additional
 * 
 *  information>
 * 
 *  <b>Working With This Guide</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for
 *  Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response.
 *  Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming
 *  language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web
 *  Services
 * 
 *  SDKs</a>> <note> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before you call any of these
 * 
 *  APIs> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home
 *  region, or a <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is
 * 
 *  returned> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home
 * 
 *  region> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could change. If you call APIs outside the home region, an
 *  <code>InvalidInputException</code> is
 * 
 *  returned> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  You must call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> to obtain the latest Migration Hub home
 * 
 *  region> </li> </ul> </note>
