 *  your organization. Alexa for Business makes it efficient to voice-enable your products and services, thus providing
 *  context-aware voice experiences for your customers. Device makers building with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) can create
 *  fully integrated solutions, register their products with Alexa for Business, and manage them as shared devices in their
