 *  This is the <i>Resource Access Manager API Reference</i>. This documentation provides descriptions and syntax for each
 *  of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources
 *  across Amazon Web Services accounts. If you have multiple Amazon Web Services accounts, you can use RAM to share those
 *  resources with other accounts. If you use Organizations to manage your accounts, then you share your resources with your
 *  organization or organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types, you can also share resources with individual
 *  Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles an users.
