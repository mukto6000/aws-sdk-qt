 * \class QtAws::RAM::AssociateResourceShareResponse
 * \brief The AssociateResourceShareResponse class provides an interace for RAM AssociateResourceShare responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsRAM
 *
 *  Use AWS Resource Access Manager to share AWS resources between AWS accounts. To share a resource, you create a resource
 *  share, associate the resource with the resource share, and specify the principals that can access the resource. The
 *  following principals are
 * 
 *  supported> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  The ID of an AWS
 * 
 *  accoun> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an OU from AWS
 * 
 *  Organization> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization from AWS
 * 
 *  Organization> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  If you specify an AWS account that doesn't exist in the same organization as the account that owns the resource share,
 *  the owner of the specified account receives an invitation to accept the resource share. After the owner accepts the
 *  invitation, they can access the resources in the resource share. An administrator of the specified account can use IAM
 *  policies to restrict access resources in the resource
