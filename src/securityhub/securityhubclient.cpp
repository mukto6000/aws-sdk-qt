 * \brief The SecurityHubClient class provides access to the AWS SecurityHub service.
 *
 * \ingroup aws-clients
 * \inmodule QtAwsSecurityHub
 *
 *  Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of your Amazon Web Services environment and
 *  resources. It also provides you with the readiness status of your environment based on controls from supported security
 *  standards. Security Hub collects security data from Amazon Web Services accounts, services, and integrated third-party
 *  products and helps you analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security issues. For
 *  more information about Security Hub, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html"> <i>Security HubUser Guide</i>
 * 
 *  </a>>
 * 
 *  When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in the Amazon Web Services Region that
 *  is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or
 *  settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other
 *  Regions, execute the same command for each Region to apply the change
 * 
 *  to>
 * 
 *  For example, if your Region is set to <code>us-west-2</code>, when you use <code>CreateMembers</code> to add a member
 *  account to Security Hub, the association of the member account with the administrator account is created only in the
 *  <code>us-west-2</code> Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region that the
 *  invitation was sent
 * 
 *  from>
 * 
 *  The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API
 * 
 *  operations> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>BatchEnableStandards</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 1 request per second, <code>BurstLimit</code> of 1 request

 *  <code>GetFindings</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 3 requests per second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of 6 requests per
