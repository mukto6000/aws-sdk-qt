 * \class QtAws::SecurityHub::DeleteInvitationsRequest
 * \brief The DeleteInvitationsRequest class provides an interface for SecurityHub DeleteInvitations requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsSecurityHub
 *
 *  Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of your AWS environment and resources. It also
 *  provides you with the compliance status of your environment based on CIS AWS Foundations compliance checks. Security Hub
 *  collects security data from AWS accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you analyze security
 *  trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security issues. For more information about Security Hub,
 *  see the <i> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">AWS Security Hub
 *  User Guide</a>
 * 
 *  </i>>
 * 
 *  When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in the AWS Region that is currently
 *  active or in the specific AWS Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change that results
 *  from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same command
 *  for each Region to apply the change to. For example, if your Region is set to <code>us-west-2</code>, when you use
 *  <code>CreateMembers</code> to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of the member account with the
 *  master account is created only in the us-west-2 Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same
 *  Region that the invite was sent
