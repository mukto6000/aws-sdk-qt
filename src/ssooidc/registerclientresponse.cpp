 *
 *  AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as AWS CLI or a native
 *  application) to register with AWS SSO. The service also enables the client to fetch the userâ€™s access token upon
 *  successful authentication and authorization with AWS SSO. This service conforms with the OAuth 2.0 based implementation
 *  of the device authorization grant standard (<a
 * 
 *  href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>)>
 * 
 *  For general information about AWS SSO, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is AWS Single Sign-On?</a> in the
 *  <i>AWS SSO User
 * 
 *  Guide</i>>
 * 
 *  This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO OIDC operations that you can call programatically and includes detailed
 *  information on data types and
 * 
 *  errors> <note>
 * 
 *  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms such as
 *  Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS SSO and other
 *  AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
