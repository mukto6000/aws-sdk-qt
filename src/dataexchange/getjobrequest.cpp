 *
 *  AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to exchange data in the cloud. You can use the AWS
 *  Data Exchange APIs to create, update, manage, and access file-based data set in the AWS
 * 
 *  Cloud>
 * 
 *  As a subscriber, you can view and access the data sets that you have an entitlement to through a subscription. You can
 *  use the APIS to download or copy your entitled data sets to Amazon S3 for use across a variety of AWS analytics and
 *  machine learning
 * 
 *  services>
 * 
 *  As a provider, you can create and manage your data sets that you would like to publish to a product. Being able to
 *  package and provide your data sets into products requires a few steps to determine eligibility. For more information,
 *  visit the AWS Data Exchange User
 * 
 *  Guide>
 * 
 *  A data set is a collection of data that can be changed or updated over time. Data sets can be updated using revisions,
 *  which represent a new version or incremental change to a data set. A revision contains one or more assets. An asset in
 *  AWS Data Exchange is a piece of data that can be stored as an Amazon S3 object. The asset can be a structured data file,
 *  an image file, or some other data file. Jobs are asynchronous import or export operations used to create or copy
