 * \class QtAws::CloudWatchLogs::DescribeSubscriptionFiltersRequest
 * \brief The DescribeSubscriptionFiltersRequest class provides an interface for CloudWatchLogs DescribeSubscriptionFilters requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsCloudWatchLogs
 *
 *  You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon EC2 instances, AWS
 *  CloudTrail, or other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch
 *  console, CloudWatch Logs commands in the AWS CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs
 * 
 *  SDK>
 * 
 *  You can use CloudWatch Logs
 * 
 *  to> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real-time</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems
 *  using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send
 *  you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data
 *  for monitoring; so, no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal
 *  terms (such as "NullReferenceException") or count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position
 *  in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found,
 *  CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you
 * 
 *  specify> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Monitor AWS CloudTrail logged events</b>: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular
 *  API activity as captured by CloudTrail and use the notification to perform
 * 
 *  troubleshooting> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Archive log data</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change
 *  the log retention setting so that any log events older than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs
 *  agent makes it easy to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You
 *  can then access the raw log data when you need
