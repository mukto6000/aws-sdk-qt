 *  <b>Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real-time</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems
 *  using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send
 *  you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data
 *  for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms
 *  (such as "NullReferenceException") or count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log
 *  data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs

 * 
 *  <b>Archive log data</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change
 *  the log retention setting so that any log events older than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs
