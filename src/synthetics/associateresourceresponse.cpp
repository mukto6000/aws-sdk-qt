 *  <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics</fullname>
 * 
 *  You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services. You can create and manage
 *  <i>canaries</i>, which are modular, lightweight scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You
 *  can set up your canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check the availability and
 *  latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs,
 *  and metrics. The canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you trace the causes of impacted
 *  nodes in your applications. For more information, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html">Using ServiceLens to Monitor the
 *  Health of Your Applications</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User
 * 
 *  Guide</i>>
 * 
 *  Before you create and manage canaries, be aware of the security considerations. For more information, see <a
