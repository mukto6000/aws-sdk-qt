 * \class QtAws::Route53Resolver::GetResolverRuleRequest
 * \brief The GetResolverRuleRequest class provides an interface for Route53Resolver GetResolverRule requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsRoute53Resolver
 *
 *  When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS resolution within the VPC from Route 53 Resolver. By
 *  default, Resolver answers DNS queries for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2 instances or Elastic Load
 *  Balancing load balancers. Resolver performs recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain
 * 
 *  names>
 * 
 *  You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network over a Direct Connect or VPN
 * 
 *  connection>
 * 
 *  <b>Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to
 *  easily resolve domain names for AWS resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53 private hosted zone. For
 *  more information, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-network-to-vpc">How
 *  DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer
 * 
 *  Guide</i>>
 * 
 *  <b>Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2 instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your
 *  network. To forward selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS queries that
 *  you want to forward (such as example.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to
 *  forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule
 *  with the most specific match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you specified in that
 *  rule. For more information, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-vpc-to-network">How
 *  Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer
 * 
 *  Guide</i>>
 * 
 *  Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have VPCs, you can choose whether to forward queries
 *  from your VPCs to your network (outbound queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or
