 * \class QtAws::Route53Resolver::DeleteResolverEndpointResponse
 * \brief The DeleteResolverEndpointResponse class provides an interace for Route53Resolver DeleteResolverEndpoint responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsRoute53Resolver
 *
 *  Here's how you set up to query an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone from your
 * 
 *  network> <ol> <li>
 * 
 *  Connect your network to a VPC using AWS Direct Connect or a
 * 
 *  VPN> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Run the following AWS CLI command to create a Resolver
 * 
 *  endpoint>
 * 
 *  <code>create-resolver-endpoint --name [endpoint_name] --direction INBOUND --creator-request-id [unique_string]
 *  --security-group-ids [security_group_with_inbound_rules] --ip-addresses SubnetId=[subnet_id]
 *  SubnetId=[subnet_id_in_different_AZ]</code>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Note the resolver endpoint ID that appears in the response. You'll use it in step
 * 
 *  3> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Get the IP addresses for the Resolver
 * 
 *  endpoints>
 * 
 *  <code>get-resolver-endpoint --resolver-endpoint-id [resolver_endpoint_id]</code>
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  In your network configuration, define the IP addresses that you got in step 3 as DNS
 * 
 *  servers>
 * 
 *  You can now query instance names in your VPCs and the names of records in your private hosted
 * 
 *  zone> </li> </ol>
 * 
 *  You can also perform the following operations using the AWS
 * 
 *  CLI> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>list-resolver-endpoints</code>: List all endpoints. The syntax includes options for pagination and
 * 
 *  filtering> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <code>update-resolver-endpoints</code>: Add IP addresses to an endpoint or remove IP addresses from an endpoint.
 * 
 *  </p </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  To delete an endpoint, use the following AWS CLI
 * 
 *  command>
 * 
 *  <code>delete-resolver-endpoint --resolver-endpoint-id [resolver_endpoint_id]</code>
