 *  network> <ol> <li>
 * 
 *  Connect your network to a VPC using AWS Direct Connect or a
 * 
 *  VPN> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Run the following AWS CLI command to create a Resolver

 *  endpoint>
 * 
 *  <code>create-resolver-endpoint --name [endpoint_name] --direction INBOUND --creator-request-id [unique_string]
 *  --security-group-ids [security_group_with_inbound_rules] --ip-addresses SubnetId=[subnet_id]

 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Note the resolver endpoint ID that appears in the response. You'll use it in step

 *  endpoints>
 * 
 *  <code>get-resolver-endpoint --resolver-endpoint-id [resolver_endpoint_id]</code>

 * 
 *  In your network configuration, define the IP addresses that you got in step 3 as DNS

 * 
 *  You can now query instance names in your VPCs and the names of records in your private hosted

 * 
 *  You can also perform the following operations using the AWS

 * 
 *  <code>list-resolver-endpoints</code>: List all endpoints. The syntax includes options for pagination and
