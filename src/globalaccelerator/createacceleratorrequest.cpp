 *  This is the <i>AWS Global Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need detailed information
 *  about AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator

 * 
 *  AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service in which you create accelerators to improve availability and
 *  performance for internet applications used by a global audience.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. These IP addresses
 *  are anycast from the AWS edge network and distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in
 *  multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints can be Elastic IP addresses,
 *  Network Load Balancers, and Application Load Balancers that are located in one AWS Region or multiple
 * 
 *  Regions>
 * 
 *  Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client
 *  location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure
 *  that internet traffic from clients is directed to only healthy
 * 
 *  endpoints>
 * 
 *  Global Accelerator includes components that work together to help you improve performance and availability for your
 * 
 *  applications> <dl> <dt>Static IP address</dt> <dd>
 * 
 *  AWS Global Accelerator provides you with a set of static IP addresses which are anycast from the AWS edge network and
 *  serve as the single fixed entry points for your clients. If you already have Elastic Load Balancing or Elastic IP
 *  address resources set up for your applications, you can easily add those to Global Accelerator to allow the resources to
 *  be accessed by a Global Accelerator static IP
 * 
 *  address> </dd> <dt>Accelerator</dt> <dd>
 * 
 *  An accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network to improve availability and performance
 *  for your internet applications that have a global audience. Each accelerator includes one or more
 * 
 *  listeners> </dd> <dt>Network zone</dt> <dd>
 * 
 *  A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS
 *  Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an
 *  accelerator, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes
 *  unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client applications can
 *  retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network
 * 
 *  zone> </dd> <dt>Listener</dt> <dd>
 * 
 *  A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the protocol and port that you
 *  configure. Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in
 *  one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute
 *  traffic to. Traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a
 * 
 *  listener> </dd> <dt>Endpoint group</dt> <dd>
 * 
 *  Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups include one or more endpoints in the
 *  Region. You can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by
 *  adjusting a setting called a <i>traffic dial</i>. The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green
 *  deployment testing for new releases across different AWS Regions, for example.
 * 
 *  </p </dd> <dt>Endpoint</dt> <dd>
 * 
 *  An endpoint is an Elastic IP address, Network Load Balancer, or Application Load Balancer. Traffic is routed to
 *  endpoints based on several factors, including the geo-proximity to the user, the health of the endpoint, and the
 *  configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are
 *  numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for example, to
 *  do performance testing within a
