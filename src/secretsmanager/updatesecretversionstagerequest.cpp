 * \brief The UpdateSecretVersionStageRequest class provides an interface for SecretsManager UpdateSecretVersionStage requests.

 *
 *  <fullname>AWS Secrets Manager API Reference</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS Secrets Manager is a web service that enables you to store, manage, and retrieve,
 * 
 *  secrets>
 * 
 *  This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html">AWS Secrets Manager User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  <b>API Version</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version
 * 
 *  2017-10-17> <note>
 * 
 *  As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code
 *  for various programming languages and platforms (such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android). The SDKs provide a
 *  convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs take care of
 *  cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the
 *  AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 * 
 *  Services</a>> </note>
 * 
 *  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the
 *  Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets
 *  Manager HTTP Query API, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html">Making Query Requests</a> in the
 *  <i>AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</i>.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Secrets Manager supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API doesn't require you to use GET for some
 *  actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for
 *  operations that require larger sizes, use a POST
 * 
 *  request>
 * 
 *  <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a
 *  href="mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com">awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com</a>, or post your feedback and
 *  questions in the <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296">AWS Secrets Manager Discussion Forum</a>.
 *  For more information about the AWS Discussion Forums, see <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa">Forums
 * 
 *  Help</a>>
 * 
 *  <b>How examples are presented</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  The JSON that AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and that the service returns as a response to HTTP
 *  query requests are single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the examples is
 *  formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters would also result
 *  in long strings that extend beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit
 *  the input as a single JSON text
 * 
 *  string>
 * 
 *  <b>Logging API Requests</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log
 *  files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests
 *  were successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets
 *  Manager and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail">Logging AWS
 *  Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail</a> in the <i>AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. To learn more about
 *  CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS CloudTrail User
