 *  Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services
 *  API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information
 *  that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager,
 *  who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for
 *  Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see <a
