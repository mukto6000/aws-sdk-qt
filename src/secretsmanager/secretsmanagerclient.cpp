 * \brief The SecretsManagerClient class provides access to the AWS Secrets Manager service.
 *
 * \ingroup aws-clients
 * \inmodule QtAwsSecretsManager
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS Secrets Manager API Reference</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS Secrets Manager is a web service that enables you to store, manage, and retrieve,
 * 
 *  secrets>
 * 
 *  This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html">AWS Secrets Manager User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  <b>API Version</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version
 * 
 *  2017-10-17> <note>
 * 
 *  As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code
 *  for various programming languages and platforms (such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android). The SDKs provide a
 *  convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs take care of
 *  cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the
 *  AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 * 
 *  Services</a>> </note>
 * 
 *  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the
 *  Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets
 *  Manager HTTP Query API, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html">Making Query Requests</a> in the
 *  <i>AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</i>.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Secrets Manager supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API doesn't require you to use GET for some
 *  actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for
 *  operations that require larger sizes, use a POST
 * 
 *  request>
 * 
 *  <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a
 *  href="mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com">awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com</a>, or post your feedback and
 *  questions in the <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296">AWS Secrets Manager Discussion Forum</a>.
 *  For more information about the AWS Discussion Forums, see <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa">Forums
 * 
 *  Help</a>>
 * 
 *  <b>How examples are presented</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  The JSON that AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and that the service returns as a response to HTTP
 *  query requests are single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the examples is
 *  formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters would also result
 *  in long strings that extend beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit
 *  the input as a single JSON text
 * 
 *  string>
 * 
 *  <b>Logging API Requests</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log
 *  files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests
 *  were successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets
 *  Manager and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail">Logging AWS
 *  Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail</a> in the <i>AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. To learn more about
 *  CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a

 * Creates a new secret. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important
 * information needed to manage the
 *
 * secret>
 *
 * Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of "versions" associated with the secret. Each
 * version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more "staging labels" that
 * identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The <code>SecretVersionsToStages</code> field of the secret
 * contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are
 * considered deprecated and are not included in the
 *
 * list>
 *
 * You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the <code>SecretString</code> parameter or binary
 * data in the <code>SecretBinary</code> parameter, but not both. If you include <code>SecretString</code> or
 * <code>SecretBinary</code> then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the
 * staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to the new

 * version> <note> <ul> <li>
 *
 * If you call an operation that needs to encrypt or decrypt the <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> for
 * a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets
 * Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>.
 * If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and
 * roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call
 * results in AWS having to create the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in
 * returning the
 *
 * result> </li> <li>
 *
 * If the secret is in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption
 * of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the
 * account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the
 * secret or when you update it by including it in the <code>KMSKeyId</code>. If you call an API that must encrypt or
 * decrypt <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> using credentials from a different account then the AWS
 * KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and
