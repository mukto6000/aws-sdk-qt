 *  <fullname>Config</fullname>
 * 
 *  Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the Amazon Web Services resources associated with your
 *  Amazon Web Services account. You can use Config to get the current and historical configurations of each Amazon Web
 *  Services resource and also to get information about the relationship between the resources. An Amazon Web Services
 *  resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic network
 *  Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of resources currently supported by Config, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported
 *  Amazon Web Services
 * 
 *  resources</a>>
 * 
 *  You can access and manage Config through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services Command
 *  Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), the Config API, or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for Config. This reference
 *  guide contains documentation for the Config API and the Amazon Web Services CLI commands that you can use to manage
 *  Config. The Config API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more information about how to
 *  sign a request with this protocol, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.
 *  For detailed information about Config features and their associated actions or commands, as well as how to work with

 * There are two types of rules: Config Custom Rules and Config Managed Rules. You can use <code>PutConfigRule</code> to

 *
 * Custom rules are rules that you can create using either Guard or Lambda functions. Guard (<a
 * href="https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard">Guard GitHub Repository</a>) is a policy-as-code
 * language that allows you to write policies that are enforced by Config Custom Policy rules. Lambda uses custom code that
 * you upload to evaluate a custom rule. If you are adding a new Custom Lambda rule, you first need to create an Lambda
 * function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use <code>PutConfigRule</code> to add a Custom
 * Lambda rule to Config, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the function. You specify
 * the ARN in the <code>SourceIdentifier</code> key. This key is part of the <code>Source</code> object, which is part of
 * the <code>ConfigRule</code> object.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Managed rules are predefined, customizable rules created by Config. For a list of managed rules, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html">List of Config Managed
 * Rules</a>. If you are adding an Config managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier for the
 * <code>SourceIdentifier</code>
 *
 * key>
 *
 * For any new rule that you add, specify the <code>ConfigRuleName</code> in the <code>ConfigRule</code> object. Do not
 * specify the <code>ConfigRuleArn</code> or the <code>ConfigRuleId</code>. These values are generated by Config for new
 *
 * rules>
 *
 * If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule by <code>ConfigRuleName</code>,
 * <code>ConfigRuleId</code>, or <code>ConfigRuleArn</code> in the <code>ConfigRule</code> data type that you use in this
