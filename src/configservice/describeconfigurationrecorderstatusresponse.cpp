 * \brief The DescribeConfigurationRecorderStatusResponse class provides an interace for ConfigService DescribeConfigurationRecorderStatus responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsConfigService
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS Config</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the AWS resources associated with your AWS account.
 *  You can use AWS Config to get the current and historical configurations of each AWS resource and also to get information
 *  about the relationship between the resources. An AWS resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an
 *  Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of
 *  resources currently supported by AWS Config, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported
 *  AWS
 * 
 *  Resources</a>>
 * 
 *  You can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the
 *  AWS Config API, or the AWS SDKs for AWS Config. This reference guide contains documentation for the AWS Config API and
 *  the AWS CLI commands that you can use to manage AWS Config. The AWS Config API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for
 *  signing requests. For more information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.
 *  For detailed information about AWS Config features and their associated actions or commands, as well as how to work with
 *  AWS Management Console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html">What Is
 *  AWS Config</a> in the <i>AWS Config Developer
