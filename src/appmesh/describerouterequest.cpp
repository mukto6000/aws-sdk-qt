 *
 *  AWS App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to monitor and control microservices. App
 *  Mesh standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high
 *  availability for your
 * 
 *  applications>
 * 
 *  App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application. You can
 *  use App Mesh with AWS Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes on AWS, and Amazon
 * 
 *  EC2> <note>
 * 
 *  App Mesh supports microservice applications that use service discovery naming for their components. For more information
 *  about service discovery on Amazon ECS, see <a
