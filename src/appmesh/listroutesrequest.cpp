 * \class QtAws::AppMesh::ListRoutesRequest
 * \brief The ListRoutesRequest class provides an interface for AppMesh ListRoutes requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsAppMesh
 *
 *  App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to monitor and control microservices. App Mesh
 *  standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high
 *  availability for your
 * 
 *  applications>
 * 
 *  App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application. You can
 *  use App Mesh with Amazon Web Services Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services, and Amazon
 * 
 *  EC2> <note>
 * 
 *  App Mesh supports microservice applications that use service discovery naming for their components. For more information
 *  about service discovery on Amazon ECS, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html">Service Discovery</a> in the
 *  <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. Kubernetes <code>kube-dns</code> and <code>coredns</code> are
 *  supported. For more information, see <a
