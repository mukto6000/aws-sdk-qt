 *
 *  App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to monitor and control microservices. App Mesh
 *  standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high
 *  availability for your
 * 
 *  applications>
 * 
 *  App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application. You can
 *  use App Mesh with Amazon Web Services Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services, and Amazon
 * 
 *  EC2> <note>
 * 
 *  App Mesh supports microservice applications that use service discovery naming for their components. For more information
 *  about service discovery on Amazon ECS, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html">Service Discovery</a> in the

 *
 * mesh>
 *
 * A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an Amazon ECS service or a Kubernetes
 * deployment. When you create a virtual node, you can specify the service discovery information for your task group, and
 * whether the proxy running in a task group will communicate with other proxies using Transport Layer Security
 *
 * (TLS)>
 *
 * You define a <code>listener</code> for any inbound traffic that your virtual node expects. Any virtual service that your
 * virtual node expects to communicate to is specified as a
 *
 * <code>backend</code>>
 *
 * The response metadata for your new virtual node contains the <code>arn</code> that is associated with the virtual node.
 * Set this value to the full ARN; for example,
 * <code>arn:aws:appmesh:us-west-2:123456789012:myMesh/default/virtualNode/myApp</code>) as the
 * <code>APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN</code> environment variable for your task group's Envoy proxy container in your task
 * definition or pod spec. This is then mapped to the <code>node.id</code> and <code>node.cluster</code> Envoy
 *
 * parameters> <note>
 *
 * By default, App Mesh uses the name of the resource you specified in <code>APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN</code> when Envoy is
 * referring to itself in metrics and traces. You can override this behavior by setting the
 * <code>APPMESH_RESOURCE_CLUSTER</code> environment variable with your own
 *
 * name> </note>
 *
 * For more information about virtual nodes, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/virtual_nodes.html">Virtual nodes</a>. You must be using
 * <code>1.15.0</code> or later of the Envoy image when setting these variables. For more information aboutApp Mesh Envoy
