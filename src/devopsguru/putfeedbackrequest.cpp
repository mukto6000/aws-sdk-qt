 * \class QtAws::DevOpsGuru::PutFeedbackRequest
 * \brief The PutFeedbackRequest class provides an interface for DevOpsGuru PutFeedback requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsDevOpsGuru
 *
 *  Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify anomalous behavior in business critical
 *  operational applications. You specify the Amazon Web Services resources that you want DevOps Guru to cover, then the
 *  Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon Web Services CloudTrail events related to those resources are analyzed. When
 *  anomalous behavior is detected, DevOps Guru creates an <i>insight</i> that includes recommendations, related events, and
 *  related metrics that can help you improve your operational applications. For more information, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html">What is Amazon DevOps Guru</a>.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are notified every time a new insight is
 *  created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to generate an OpsItem in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for each insight
 *  to help you manage and track your work addressing insights.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  To learn about the DevOps Guru workflow, see <a
