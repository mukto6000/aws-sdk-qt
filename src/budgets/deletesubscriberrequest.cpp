 * \brief The DeleteSubscriberRequest class provides an interface for Budgets DeleteSubscriber requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsBudgets
 *
 *  The AWS Budgets API enables you to use AWS Budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.
 *  The API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for AWS
 *  Budgets.

 *  under-utilized> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>RI coverage budgets</b> - Define a coverage threshold, and receive alerts when the number of your instance hours that
