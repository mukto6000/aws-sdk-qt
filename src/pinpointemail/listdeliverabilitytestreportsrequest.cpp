 * \class QtAws::PinpointEmail::ListDeliverabilityTestReportsRequest
 * \brief The ListDeliverabilityTestReportsRequest class provides an interface for PinpointEmail ListDeliverabilityTestReports requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsPinpointEmail
 *
 *  <fullname>Amazon Pinpoint Email Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  This document contains reference information for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon Pinpoint</a> Email
 *  API, version 1.0. This document is best used in conjunction with the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">Amazon Pinpoint Developer
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions.
 *  For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region">AWS Regions and Endpoints</a> in the
 *  <i>Amazon Web Services General
 * 
 *  Reference</i>>
 * 
 *  In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each
 *  other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
 *  Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency.
 *  To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see <a
 *  href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global
